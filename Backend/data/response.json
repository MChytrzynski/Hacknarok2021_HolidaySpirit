Global politics have destroyed blacks. Instead, they talk about “racism” as if black people are so unsophisticated that they can’t see truth or facts for themselves. This professor says that black voters see the truth and are much smarter than Democrats give them credit – and they’re breaking for Trump this election.

We are renewing our appeal for anyone with information to come forward,” Met officer John Goodwin shared as part of the appeal. Officers would not be drawn on the rumours that the man had robbed his employers of his salary and signing on bonus before disappearing. “Paul also answers to ‘Pog’ and in addition to being able to play in all variety of positions he would be easily identified by his haircut, which looks like it was done by a blind man with a great sense of humour,” officer Goodwin added. Police hope that with his employers Manchester United being back in the headlines recently following a mixed run of form, they can use the publicity surrounding it to find Paul safe and sound. “Just come home, Paul,” Pogba’s emotional manager Jose Mourinho urged as part of the renewed search appeal. One of the UK’s most intriguing missing persons inquiry ever, Mr. Pogba’s absence has sparked what experts have called mass hallucinations as members of the public claim to have seen him on television on multiple occasions. Police hopes were dashed last week when they rushed to London’s Chelsea area last Sunday after sightings of the man were reported but a search of the location proved otherwise.",

        "content": "October 26, 2016 Economists and eminent human rights lawyers alike have this week applauded the British stance on re-settling refugees from the Calais ‘jungle’. Professor Donald Rosarch from the Denver School for Human Rights Law mused ‘We admire the wisdom of western nations with aging populations angrily rejecting cohorts of fit young men and boys, none of whom are likely to be a burden to health services for some thirty or forty years. After their ordeal traveling thousands of miles on foot, sometimes after weeks at sea watching their friends die needlessly, these people somehow retain a remarkable humility and willingness to work. It is a dangerous situation.’ Ethel Brantingham from Kettering who eats kippers for breakfast in line with her political beliefs who named her terrier pup ‘Nigel’ reflected the views of the British electorate: ‘We simply cannot tolerate an influx of this sort of attitude, these people have learned nothing about entitlement and the values that made Britain great. Some of them even want to train as teachers or doctors. Imagine them in five years time, raising children and paying taxes in their droves, just as the majority of us were planning a neglected death in an underfunded state nursing home. Boris Johnson was right. Fuck everybody, its all about me.’ Share this story... Posted: Oct 26th, 2016 by Squudge Click for more article by Squudge .. More Stories about: News In Brief 0",

Après ses études, le club de l’académie, Rossiyanka, proposa à Nadejda, qui jouait alors déjà dans l’équipe jeunes de Russie, 9 000 roubles (120 euros) par mois. Ce furent les représentants d’un autre club, Zorky, qui la sauvèrent de la misère en la payant trois fois plus cher. Mais cet argent ne suffisait de toute façon pas pour quoi que ce soit. « Je ne peux rien m’acheter avec l’argent que je gagne au football , a raconté Nadjeda dans une interview à Eurosport en 2014.

Durant ces deux ans, Nadedja fait des débuts remarqués dans l’équipe nationale et est en tête des marqueurs du championnat russe 2016 dans l’équipe Chertanovo de Moscou. Cependant, la star du football féminin russe vit toujours modestement, comme tout le football féminin en Russie, qui paie 3 000 roubles (40 euros) de prime pour une victoire, et dont les joueuses en déplacement s’entassent dans les wagons de troisième classe. « Les salaires des hommes, on n’en rêve même pas. Je ne veux même pas entendre parler de ces sommes. Qu’est-ce que… je pourrais faire de 50 000 dollars ? Rien de bon… J’irais faire la fête, je perdrais la raison.

In June 2011, the Bureau and the Russian Ministry of Defense signed a state contract for the Sarmat’s development. The prospective strategic missile system is being developed in order to assuredly and effectively fulfil objectives of nuclear deterrent by Russia’s strategic forces. ”And now today, Putin explains:*PUTIN: INTERMEDIATE NUCLEAR FORCES TREATY SHOULD BE OBSERVED *PUTIN: RUSSIA, U.S. MUST BREAK VICIOUS CIRCLE OF CONFRONTATION *PUTIN: RUSSIA HAS TO DEVELOP ITS NUCLEAR ATTACK SYSTEMS *PUTIN: U.S. PUSHED RUSSIA TO ARMS RACE IN NUCLEAR SPHERE",

Victor Sperandeo manages over $3 billion, has been in the business 45 years, and has worked with famous individuals such as Leon Cooperman and George Soros. Below is what Sperandeo had to say . Victor Sperandeo: “KWN readers need to be cautious about the gold market heading into tomorrow because the U.S. government is going to release a politically influenced GDP number that implies very strong growth… IMPORTANT: To hear which legend just spoke with KWN about $8,000 gold and the coming mania in the gold, silver, and mining shares markets CLICK HERE OR ON THE IMAGE BELOW. If the GDP number comes in well above 2 percent growth, that would be used (by the Fed) to attack the gold market. I expect a number of around 2.6 percent for GDP. This would create a rally in the dollar and additional downside pressure in the gold market. If The Fed Smashes Gold Friday, Buy The Dip For what it’s worth, if gold gets hit tomorrow I would be a buyer because I think that will represent the correction low in the secular move higher. The Fed is not going to raise rates and so reality will set in and gold should strengthen for the remainder of the year and into next.” King World News note: For those of you who look to accumulate physical gold and silver on dips, if Victor is correct, tomorrow may represent a very good buying opportunity to add to your physical holdings.

        "content": "NASA to test in flight folding wing page: 1 link NASA is set to begin testing a new wing design that would change shape in flight, bending up or down, to increase yaw stability, reduce required rudder size, and decrease drag. The Boeing 777X is set to introduce wingtips that fold on the ground, to allow the aircraft to fit in existing gates with a longer wingspan. NASA is set to begin testing the Spanwise Adaptive Wing, which would add shape-memory alloy actuators to the wingtip area that would bend the tips up or down. The SMA actuators would activate when heated electrically, so there is no need for complex hydraulic lines or actuators. Beginning in Spring of 2017, NASA will start flying the Area-I PTERA UAV. It has a 176 inch wingspan, with the outer 15 inches moving as far as 75 degrees up or down. PTERA is not set up for SAW, but it appears that it could see a 40% rudder authority. The idea behind SAW is similar to what was done with the XB-70, with the wingtips angled down. Boeing will introduce folding wings to commercial aviation when the 777X airliner enters service at the end of 2019. But the devices could become commonplace on future aircraft as wingspans increase in an effort to reduce drag and fuel burn. The 777X has almost 24 ft. more wingspan than today’s 777 to optimize lift distribution and maximize cruise efficiency. Folding the tips on the ground keeps the larger aircraft compatible with existing taxiway and gate size restrictions. But NASA is investigating whether also folding the wing in flight could save still more fuel. The Spanwise Adaptive Wing (SAW) concept will be tested on the ground and in flight in a rapid feasibility assessment under NASA’s new Convergent Aeronautics Solutions project. The goal is to show that angling the outboard wing sections up or down can increase yaw stability and control, and reduce rudder size and tail drag.",

Most nations’ laws provide for being tried in absentia, but in Western nations, it’s not usually because the defendant refuses to be there.] Defiant Dutch anti-Islam politician Geert Wilders said Friday he will refuse to attend his hate speech trial next week, dubbing it a travesty aimed at silencing him as the country prepares for 2017 elections. The trial opens on Monday before a three-judge bench with the far-right politician facing charges of insulting a racial group and inciting racial hatred for comments he made about Moroccans living in the Netherlands. “It is my right and my duty as a politician to speak about the problems in our country,” Wilders said in a statement Friday, dubbing the case “a political trial, in which I refuse to cooperate”. It comes as opinion polls have shown his far-right Freedom Party (PVV) doing well ahead of March elections. … Set to last until November 25, the trial focuses on a comment made at a March 2014 rally when Wilders asked supporters if they wanted “fewer or more Moroccans in your city and in the Netherlands?” When the crowd shouted back “Fewer! Fewer!” Wilders answered: “We’re going to organise that.”",

By speculating about these mysterious emails, that we now know had absolutely NOTHING to do with Hillary Clinton, Comey may have been in direct violation of the Hatch Act . Let’s hope Director Comey will have to endure his own investigation very soon! Speaking of speculation, on a special edition of CNN’s AC360 Sunday night, Anderson Cooper brought up that very thing to Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. “Is it responsible for someone who might be president of the United States to be, in your words, ‘speculating’ about an active investigation when he has no actual facts?” Kellyanne tried to change the attention back to Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server, but Anderson wasn’t having it and asks again. “Right, you are not answering the question, though.

        "content": "Forces Still Several Kilometers From Mosul by Jason Ditz, October 27, 2016 Share This Adding to the upbeat official assessment of the invasion of Mosul, Centcom chief Gen. Joseph Votel today told the press that he believes the forces involved have “ probably killed about 800-900 ISIS fighters ” in the past week and a half. By contrast, Votel insisted that only 57 Iraqi troops were killed, and another 30 Kurdish Peshmerga. Unmentioned was a US soldier also killed in the fighting, embedded with the Peshmerga and killed by a roadside bomb north of Mosul. It is difficult to get accurate information on ISIS casualties, and the official figures from Iraqi officials are almost always dramatically overstated in an effort to sell the war as a runaway success. There are reasons to be skeptical about the 800-900 figure, however. The main reason is that Iraqi and Kurdish forces are still several kilomters away from the outskirts of Mosul, mostly occupying empty villages, and while ISIS has sent out some forces of skirmishers to slow their advance, it is believed the vast majority of their defensive forces have remained in Mosul, gearing up for the eventual attack and setting assorted traps.

Il governo inglese riprenderà quindi il programma di addestramento dei cosiddetti combattenti moderati, iniziato nel 2014 da Obama.L’Esercito Siriano Libero è stato creato dalla Francia nel 2011, intorno al capo libico di al-Qaeda Abdelhakim Belhaj. L’operazione era stata presentata come un aiuto ai disertori siriani guidati dal colonnello Riad el-Asaad. Gradualmente, i membri dell’ESL si sono poi congiunti ad al-Qaeda. Nel 2016, l’etichetta ESL è stata ripescata dalla Turchia per denominare le proprie milizie turcomanne.A loro volta, gli Stati Uniti avevano speso mezzo miliardo di dollari per l’addestramento dei nuovi “combattenti ribelli”. La totalità dei soldati addestrati oggi però appartiene ad al-Qaeda.È quindi molto probabile che il nuovo programma britannico mascheri un altro aiuto ad al-Qaeda.TraduzioneRachele MarmettiIl Cronista",

        "content": "Print Shortly after the story first broke in March 2015 that Hillary Clinton had used a private email account and homebrew server during her tenure as secretary of state, the Democratic nominee went into damage control. Her first public remarks came in the form of a press avail at the U.N. , where she told reporters: [W]hen I got to work as secretary of state, I opted for convenience to use my personal email account, which was allowed by the State Department, because I thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two. She went on to emphasize that everything she did was above board and according to Hoyle. But despite her assurances — and perhaps as a direct consequence of her propensity for lying — the story refused to go away. Questions arose about whether any of the emails transmitted from or to her personal account contained classified information, which she vehemently denied. Now, thanks to WikiLeaks, an email written by her campaign’s director of communications, Jennifer Palmieri , has emerged that suggests Clinton’s denial may have been less than forthright. The email is dated May 22, 2015 and addresses the candidate’s demeanor at another press event: The highlighted portion of the text seems pretty conclusive in its confirmation that her campaign team and Clinton herself knew at that early date that some of the communications in her private account had indeed contained classified data. Clinton has still never admitted, despite evidence to the contrary unearthed by the FBI, that she used her email to conduct affairs of state. Perhaps now she will?",

He condemned and damned everyone. He later went to the mountain again and got a second set of of the 10 Commandments.In Leviticus 18:21 God forbid the chosen people to do such a horrible thing:Do not give any of your children to be sacrificed to Moloch, for you must not profane the name of your God. I am the LORD.God also ordered in Leviticus 20:2 to 20:5 that any follower of Moloch must be put to death:Say to the Israelites: ‘Any Israelite or any foreigner residing in Israel who sacrifices any of his children to Moloch is to be put to death. The members of the community are to stone him.I myself will set my face against him and will cut him off from his people; for by sacrificing his children to Moloch, he has defiled my sanctuary and profaned my holy name.If the members of the community close their eyes when that man sacrifices one of his children to Moloch and if they fail to put him to death,I myself will set my face against him and his family and will cut them off from their people together with all who follow him in prostituting themselves to Moloch.This is NOT a joke people, this is serious SATANIST stuff and either you believe in God or not, it’s your problem, but what matters is that these people DO BELIEVE IN WHAT THEY DO!16 years ago, on 15 July 2000 Alex Jones was the first and only to date, to ever infiltrate and secretly videotape the Bohemian Grove .

        "content": "October 28, 2016 A row has broken out over a review of Ken Loach’s new film, “I, Daniel Blake” with several benefit claimants refusing to believe that its author, Toby Young, could possibly have happened. Young’s review in The Mail, in which he described Loach’s representation of common DWP practices such as delaying appeals and giving out benefit sanctions for minor errors as “far fetched”, was met with anger and incredulity in online forums. However, many of the claimants who were involved in researching the film have simply denied that Young was even real. Said Sarah, 41, who claims ESA for chronic Parkinson’s and has been forced to make several appeals, “Toby Young simply doesn’t ring true. We’re meant to believe that he’s a journalist, but he’s more of a lefty’s version of what a Daily Mail reviewer ought to be like. Where is the research, the information? I can’t really believe that journalism’s that bad, it just isn’t credible.” Jack, 47, who has been sanctioned twice on JSA, was more forthright: “This is a fraud. Everyone knows that it’s easy to impersonate a journalist and the idea that this so-called “Toby Young”, if that is what he’s really called, bears any resemblance to how things are on the ground is simply ludicrous”. The Daily Mail have hit back, saying Toby Young was “the genuine article” and that “if we didn’t give an outlet to marginalised Oxbridge graduates with appalling senses of entitlement, then there was a real danger that their voices might be drowned out by the cries of the needy and the vulnerable”. Mental health campaigners have also responded angrily, saying that Young was “clearly delusional”, needing “help rather than disbelief”. The DWP have refused to get involved in the row and, when asked to comment, a spokesman merely spat on the ground and gave me a piecing stare. andyiong",

In a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, the senators, led by Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James Inhofe (R-Okla.), noted that American commitments to the international Paris climate deal aren’t binding and could be undone by an unfriendly Congress or Republican presidential administration. “Joining international agreements using ‘sole executive agreement authority’ leaves the door open for any future administration to alter its course,” the senators wrote. “Understanding this is especially important in the context of climate change policies, because Congress’s unwillingness to support the president’s international efforts is not the result of gridlock — it is the result of explicit opposition.”",

When a Fukushima power plant was hit by the tsunami, it began releasing the largest amount of radioactive materials. Now, 3 years later, there are serious concerns about the levels of radiation contamination leaking not only into Japan, but also into the Pacific Ocean and beyond. Seems like to me that mainstream media does not even want to cover this topic nor do they want to warn the masses.

He also added that he does not think the Podesta emails will have an impact, adding the influence of MSM pushing Hillary. The Podesta emails will make no difference to the election result, according to Assange. “I don’t think there’s any chance of Donald Trump winning the election, even with the amazing material we are publishing, because most of the media organizations are strongly aligned with Hillary Clinton,” he said. sorry this is RT, but many won't cover this Interesting considering he implied he would have a bombshell before the election.

The details are still scant, but ISIS claims that the council was established in part to discuss the formation of a tribal anti-ISIS coalition in the area. They claimed 15 killed and 25 wounded, labeling the victims “apostates.” Afghan government officials put the toll a lot lower, saying only four were killed and seven wounded in the attack. Nangarhar is the main base of operations for ISIS forces in Afghanistan, though they’ve recently begun to pop up around several other provinces. Whether the council was at the point of establishing an anti-ISIS coalition or not, this is in keeping with the group’s reaction to any sign of growing local resistance, with ISIS having similarly made an example of tribal groups in Iraq and Syria during their establishment there.

The UN harshly criticized them for their use of “ indiscriminate ” weapons, warning it could amount to war crimes. Perhaps the biggest issue, though as-yet-unproven, is reports that the rebels have begun to use chlorine-filled shells in their attacks. Syrian media reported 35 civilians were suffering from effects of the toxic gas, though the rebels denied using them. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported at least 21 people killed over the weekend, amid heavy fighting around western Aleppo. The offensive began Friday, with the Nusra-led rebels trying to end a siege of their eastern half of the city. This has been a recurring situation in Aleppo since it boiled down to just the military and this rebel faction, with both sides having repeatedly launched offensives and counter-offensives over the last several months, trading sieges and strikes against one anothers’ neighborhoods. This has resulted in heavy casualties for the civilians stuck in the city, facing regular sieges that they are rarely as able to survive as the combatants, and taking the brunt of the rockets, airstrikes, and artillery attacks. The addition of chemical weapons, even primitive ones, threaten to make the matter far worse. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",

For example, urban farms often act as a social incubator, bringing together communities and connecting cultures. Many also impact significantly on health and well-being, allowing city-dwellers to access fresh food and sometimes even supplement diets.We found that those connected to The Federation of City Farms and Community Gardens were strongest. They gained value from the networking with other such sites across the UK.A few in this extensive network have existed for over 30 years, and are still going due to the excellent support from both locals and the wider network. Ultimately, the idea of urban farming is not to replace traditional rural farms, but rather to complement and add value.To push forward with urban farming, there’s a need to build on what works – in particular, to learn from urban farms in the US, which are expanding and are on a different scale entirely to anywhere else.Read the complete article here.",

The scientific study, carried out by a team of genetic experts at Trinity College Dublin, found that the majority of Irish males aged between 16-30 have grown a lot weaker physically and less resilient to cold temperatures over the past 60 years. Of 100 Irish males tested in physical work environments, 67% percent moaned about being tired and fatigued after just two minutes. “We put the study group to work on a local farm picking spuds, weeding gardens and doing general old time shit,” lead researcher Professor Conor Tracey explains, “We even made them travel to work in their bare feet. The results we got back were absolutely appalling to tell you the truth. Only a small minority of the men got on with their chores without complaining”. In fact, further testing found that 89% of those studied were ‘perishers’, a trait increasing in modern day males. “Nearly every one of them began whinging about the cold during the picking stones in the frost task,” Dr. Tracey added, “They began complaining that their ikkle fingies were sore, and that they couldn’t feel their hands or feet from the cold. Poor pets. Several lads even tried to pretend they were sick in a bid to get out of the job, and one 18-year-old subject began crying for his mammy like a big baby, so he did”. The study concluded that 92% of Irish men were found to be made of nothing these days, compared to the young fellas of years ago who used to walk to school in their bare feet, before then going to work in the mines for 18 hours a day.",

        "content": "WikiLeaks continues to be a treasure trove of info about the behind-the-scenes rigging of what is turning out to be the most infamous presidential election in American history. Remember the first debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump and the conspiracy surrounding “podiumgate” ? Hillary required a specially built podium under the pretext that she didn’t want to appear shorter than Trump. After the debate was over, however, a sneaky “cleaner man” was caught on tape approaching Hillary’s podium multiple times, removing various items and looking as shady as possible while doing it. What could also clearly be seen was what appeared to be a lit screen dimming specifically in her podium and not in Trump’s just after the debate officially ended. This led to lots of speculation on whether or not Hillary cheated during the first debate against Trump and other debates as well, having her comments fed to her. Well, if the Wikileaks Podesta emails are any indication, it’s very possible. Why? Because apparently Hillary can’t give long speeches without a podium. In fact, these emails (and this isn’t even all of them, but enough for you to get the picture) prove her team is well aware of the fact that everything has to be kept “short and sweet” unless Hillary has a podium. So how are we supposed to believe she was able to speak at the 90-minutes debates without prepared notes being fed to her somehow? Especially that final debate where she appeared to be reading more than writing, looking down all the time at some sort of lit screen embedded in the podium as pointed out in other debates, as shown in the video above.

They also paid over $100,000 more to his son Jose Santos-Hernandez.The U.S. Federal Government purchased information from them on drug trafficking.The two men traveled to several different countries. Some of the countries the DEA are not welcome. The duo made secret recordings of people allegedly believed to be involved in the illegal drug trade.One of the nations involved was Venezuela, where the Santos-Pena family recorded two of Cilia Flores nephews. Cilia Flores is the wife of the nation’s president who was handling a large amount of cocaine.However, in April 2016, federal agents discovered that the father-son duo was illegally involved in illegal drug trafficking. Just as the nephew of the Venezuelan first lady was about to go on trial in New York, the duo pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges.They also admitted to trafficking drugs while they were assisting the DEA of building the Venezuelan case last fall. However, prosecutors continue their case against Cilia Flores’ two nephews, although Jose Santos-Hernandez did not testify at their trial.Written by John A.

        "content": "Tom Cahill | November 17, 2016 In a stunning move, President Obama has announced he won’t allow any oil and gas leases on land deemed sacred by the Blackfeet Tribe. After the announcement, Devon Energy, which was hoping to drill on 130,000 acres in Montana — some of which housed Glacier National Park and Blackfeet land — will have all of its oil and gas leases cancelled on the disputed land. The Bureau of Land Management had previously granted 15 leases to Devon Energy in the northwestern part of the Big Sky State. “We are proud to have worked alongside the Blackfeet Nation, U.S. Forest Service and Devon Energy to achieve this important milestone, rolling back decades-old leases and reinforcing the importance of developing resources in the right ways and the right places,” said Department of the Interior Secretary Sally Jewell in a public statement . National Parks Conservation Association official Michael Jamison told the Washington Post that the cancellation of the leases is an important milestone for the preservation of various protected species like wolf, bear, and elk. “There aren’t many places like this left in the lower 48,” Jamison said. The move is particularly significant in the context of the ongoing protests at the construction site of the Dakota Access Pipeline, where hundreds of indigenous tribes have gathered with the Standing Rock Sioux to prevent the pipeline from being built. Protesters say the pipeline, which would run underneath the Missouri River, would endanger a crucial drinking water supply for millions of people in several states. For its part, Devon will receive a little over $200,000 for the cancellation of the leases, which were issued in the 1980s with no drilling occurring since the leases were granted.

Reportedly, it took 40 police officers to gain control of the situation.] An Israeli speaker’s talk at a London college campus scheduled for this week was canceled on Wednesday. Why? Because, according to the cancelation notice sent by the student union, “there had been controversy” when he spoke at the campus two years prior, and the hosting organization failed to disclose that when the room was booked for the talk. After cries of suppression of speech and vehement protests, the university stepped in and “un”canceled the talk. Hen Mazzig’s talk at University College, London, was reinstated. It would take place, as scheduled, on Thursday evening, Oct. 27. The response by the anti-Israel mob was swift and the attack was vicious. A protest was called. Outside the room where Mazzig was scheduled to speak, livid demonstrators screamed for murder and the end of Israel. “Intifada, Intifada!” and “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free!” They barred the entrance to the talk while pummeling the doors and windows, leering malevolently. Two thugs yanked open a window, hurling themselves into the room, launching several students inside into panic attacks. A woman inside kept repeating: “This is like the Warsaw Ghetto!”",

Produce harvested from the White House garden will also appear. Like every aspect of the evening, the menu was created with the array of guests in mind. “We want to make sure that our Wagyu beef is all Halal, all of our purveyors make sure that everything we use is secure, came from reliable sources, and the things that we use here are wholesome and good for our guests,” Comerford said.~ Ok then, no body parts.",

Right? The FBI. I think they’re going to right the ship, folks. I think they’re going to right the ship, and they’re going to save their great reputation by doing so.” The speculation is that the FBI is likely to review the new emails and stick by their original finding that Hillary Clinton did nothing wrong. Trump and the Republicans are jumping to some conclusions. They know that Clinton is guilty without any evidence to support their beliefs. They are assuming that the FBI is going to find evidence that Hillary Clinton did something wrong, and they think that the emails are their ticket to getting Trump elected. Trump has no political skills, and no idea when to use a gentle touch and stop. The Republican nominee destroyed any hope that the GOP had of using the reopened email investigation to their advantage by letting his habits of lying and changing positions on a whim take hold. The email scandal isn’t going to help Republicans. It hasn’t before, and it won’t now, but Trump’s over the top incompetence has killed any boost that Republicans might have gotten from the story.",

        "content": "Zach Cartwright | November 6, 2016 President Obama is relentlessly mocking Donald Trump in the wake of news that the candidate has had control of his Twitter account usurped by staffers. While on the campaign stump for Hillary Clinton in the battleground state of Florida, Obama poked fun at the GOP presidential nominee’s campaign revoking exclusive access to his Twitter account, which he has used for years as a platform to blast unfiltered 140-character missives at his political opponents and pop culture figures. The 44th President of the United States made the point that presidents require a larger degree of self-control than what Trump has shown throughout the election cycle. “In the last two days, they had so little confidence in his self control, they said: ‘We’re just going to take away your Twitter.’ Now, if somebody cant handle a Twitter account, they can’t handle the nuclear code,” Obama said. “If somebody starts tweeting at three in the morning ’cause SNL made fun of you, then you can’t handle the nuclear code.” The New York Times recently reported that Trump now has all of his tweets pre-screened by campaign staffers like Hope Hicks, who handles media relations for the Trump campaign. The billionaire real estate developer’s days of tweeting tirades at former beauty pageant stars are over, for the time being, with his campaign aides working overtime to keep the candidate on message in the remaining 48 hours before Americans cast their ballots on Tuesday. Watch video of Obama’s mocking of Trump in Kissimmee, Florida below: Florida is a contentious, must-win state for both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The latest polling average from RealClearPolitics shows Clinton with a paper-thin 0.9 percent advantage over Trump. Zach Cartwright is an activist and author from Richmond, Virginia.

I will defeat ISIS , I will protect America.” Hillary says she was in New York City on 9/11 (She wasn’t) pic.twitter.com/3ppmncpeTI — Charlie Spiering (@charliespiering) November 2, 2016 But Clinton was in Washington D.C. on 9/11, which is unsurprising, as Congress was in session and she was the sitting senator for New York. In the words of Politico, which wrote about her actions that day: She had CNN on as she talked on the phone with her legislative director when the first plane hit. Then the second. By the time she got to the Capitol, the Pentagon had been hit by a third plane. Capitol police were evacuating Senate office buildings. She dialed her daughter, who was in New York. She dialed her husband, who was in Australia. She and other senators received a briefing at the Capitol police station early in the evening. And after “a day indelibly etched in my mind,” and as nightfall approached, Clinton joined congressional colleagues on the steps of the Capitol, standing next to some of her fiercest political opponents, singing “God Bless America” with tears in her eyes. Clinton did go back to New York, but only the following day. Since all regular air traffic was grounded, she flew on a special FEMA flight to the city with Rep. Charlie Rangel and fellow Sen. Chuck Schumer. Article reposted with permission from The Daily Caller  ",

I loved Pam and she was amazing at communicating even weeks after sessions if we had questions, so I questioned my body: am I comfortable with Jerry working in my energy field? He called me right after the sessions and even offered a Skype communication if I wanted. He knew that I had done lots of work on myself in past lives, which confirmed to me that he was real, because I was a Tibetan Monk and they spend a life time working on their karma. He is as good as Pam was as a healer. That same night I had lots of energy, I could not sleep, I felt well. The next 4 days I felt very tired, I could not get enough sleep. Then came the times of the essences and oils. Alexandra and Steven had emailed me and called me to follow up on how I was doing. They truly are amazing at what they do in every ways. The potions were on their way. They hit me like a brick, I went emotional, not grounded and vertiginous. I was able to catch my mind by finding the gratitude for the opportunity that these 3 people, the oils and essences had been given me, I was to be free in a big way, and that to me was worth a couple of weeks of symptoms of emotional, physical and spiritual release.

        "content": "posted by Eddie A voting machine has been caught on camera casting a ballot for a Democrat after the voter selected a Republican. Donald Trump thinks Hillary Clinton and the Democrats are going to steal the next election. “ I’m afraid the election is going to be rigged, I have to be honest ,” he told a campaign rally last week. The mainstream media are trying to portray him as mad, but take a look at this evidence: This is attempted election theft through manipulation of the computerized voting machines – and it must be stopped. The party in power in a given state controls the programming of the voting machines. When the establishment asked Trump if he would accept the outcome of the election a whole three weeks before the event, it was like asking a sports coach if he thinks the game was refereed fairly before the game is played. And the Democrats are now attempting to cover all bases. They are sueing the RNC over Trump’s election rigging claims, and also suggesting if any evidence of voter fraud does emerge, then it is probably Russia’s fault. Do not believe that voter fraud does not exist. It’s real, the numbers are huge, and it’s undermining true democracy in the United States. We must fight to eradicate it. If you notice any sign if possible voter fraud or election rigging, call the Trump Ballot Security Project toll free on 1-855-245-4634 or email [email protected] source:",

It was the whistleblower Edward Snowdon who taught us about the extent of the cooperation between the NSA, telecommunication companies and European governments. Some of us were extremely concerned about these revelations while others learned to live with them—but very few of us realised that sooner rather than later, it would be we the people who actually gained such free access to the secrets of our big brothers. Just a week or so before the American presidential election, it has become clear that, rather than them looking at us and making us feel vulnerable and exposed, it is actually us, the people, who are sitting in front of our TV screens being entertained by Clinton’s emails and the revelations about her ties with the most horrible people on the planet. It seems as if us ‘little brothers’ are growing tired of our ‘big brother’ and such a realisation points to a shift in consciousness that could lead to complete social revolution. The awareness is certainly here already. Gilad Atzmon is an Israeli jazz musician, author and political activist. His new book, “The Wandering Who,” may be ordered from amazon.com or amazon.co.uk .",

Share on Twitter Print This Post The reason why the Clinton email scandal is getting pushed 11 days before the election has nothing to with Trump’s DOA White House bid, and everything to do with helping Republicans keep control of Congress. On the surface, the sudden revival of Hillary Clinton’s emails looks like an October surprise designed to help Republican nominee Donald Trump. The problem with this theory is that both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge that Trump is toast. Unless Hillary Clinton’s emails say, “LOL. I was the shooter on the grassy knoll,” there is nothing that would stop her from winning the election. In fact, the emails FBI Director was investigating did not come from Clinton or her server. They seem to have very little to do with Hillary Clinton or her presidential campaign. The emails are like catnip to Republican voters, who have been promised for years that if they keep sending Republicans to Congress, they’ll bring down a Democratic president, and that is the real reason behind the email scandal revival. For the next ten days, Republican Congressional candidates are going to be able to campaign on investigating Hillary Clinton. The Republican candidates can pretend like Trump doesn’t exist because their new pitch to voters is, “Vote for me and I’ll bring down Hillary.” Donald Trump is a lost cause. Millions of ballots have already been cast in swing states. Trump is being out organized and trounced by Clinton on the ground. To understand the real value of the email scandal to the Republican Party, look down the ballot. The Hillary Clinton email scandal is nothing more Republican get out the vote operation to save their majorities in Congress.",

If Hillary Clinton wins the election in November, she's going to have a whole lot more to deal with than just typical Commander-in-Chief stuff. With the massive Wikileaks dump and the controversial contributions her foundation has benefited from, House Republicans are seriously considering an investigation. In fact, she could quickly find herself in the same boat as her husband, with elected officials calling for her impeachment. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told NBC News : \"You're going to still have a clamor for a serious criminal investigation of Mrs. Clinton's conduct with respect to her emails and the [Clinton] Foundation]. There's been no systematic investigation of various issues. I know this generation of Republican leaders is loath to exercise these tools, but impeachment is something that's relevant. They see [the oversight process] as an opportunity in some measure to keep their opponents off-kilter, but they don't want to do the substantive and principled work to truly hold corrupt politicians, or the administration, or anyone accountable.\" Since the FBI recommended no indictment for Hillary Clinton, the call to reopen the case into her email server has been shut down by the Bureau. On the other hand, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump isn't satisfied with the outcome. He even wants to go as far to investigate the FBI's investigation if he takes the White House. Meanwhile, Judicial Watch has launched an investigation into Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe , whose political organization donated about $500,000 to the campaign coffers of Dr. Jill McCabe, the wife of an FBI figurehead who helped provide oversight over the investigation into Clinton's private server.

Add to the list a 56 year-old Michigan Man who is now facing felony weapons charges after holding six children – ages 12 to 14 – at gunpoint and forcing them to the ground for allegedly knocking down his Trump yard sign. That’s right. The kids were terrorized at gun point over a Trump yard sign. Michael Kubek, 56, of Allen Park, MI, said that he was angry at the children because he believed they had ‘vandalized’ his Trump sign, although he hadn’t actually seen them do it. The children told the police that they were simply walking to a local park when an unhinged Kubek “pulled out a pistol and ordered them to sit down on a neighbor’s lawn.” In any case, it appears that the ‘vandalism’ consisted in the sign simply being knocked down – perhaps Kubek should take out his anger on the wind – and the children were reportedly “traumatized” by the experience. When police, who were called to the scene by Kubek’s mother, arrived, they found the children lying on the grass with Kubek “standing over them yelling and cursing.” The children said he had pointed a gun at them and a neighbor described Kubek using “very profane language.” According to local news channel Fox 2, “the kids said they tried to tell Kubek they did not damage his sign, but it only resulted with Kubek telling them to shut up and continue cursing at them.” Kubek claims he felt “threatened” because he was “outnumbered” by the adolescents and invoked his second amendment right. Luckily, he was arrested by local police and had his gun confiscated — although he has now been released on a $5,000 bail. Just another day in Trump’s America, folks. Hopefully, the nightmare will be over soon…",

There really is no more astute animal at realising when the time to bolt and never been seen again has come, well they’re second to John Delaney on that front, but other than that no one has a better nose for this stuff,” rodent expert Michael Pest shared with WWN. “Shite and you’d almost forgotten about Pat Hickey and all that stuff, the ship was set to right itself,” confirmed an OCI insider, as he used a bucket to scoop water out of the premises as it creaked slowly into the nearby sea. Senior OCI members had confirmed as recently as September that the course of their organisation had been chartered to calmer waters, but word that rats feel the vessel isn’t long for this world has caused fresh panic. In recent days John Delaney and Kevin Kilty have disembarked the OCI as it continues to take on dangerous levels of water. “I’ll be fucked if I’m staying on and drowning with you lot, so long,” Delaney allegedly said in his resignation letter.",

Tel Kurdi, like all the remaining rebel areas in Ghouta, was under siege for some time, and the rebel forces within fell back almost immediately, with no reports of major fighting, and the rebels bragging of a “scorched earth” policy destroying everything of value on their way out. One of the members of the rebel council blamed the mounting losses on internal fights among the fashions. Indeed, over the past several months a lot of towns and villages in the area have fallen, either in military offensives or in negotiated pullouts. The negotiated pullouts have been the most effective way to displace large amounts of rebels lately, with the rebels getting sent north into Nusra Front territory around Idlib. This is increasingly boiling down to government control of the area around Damascus, and increased rebel influence in the north. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",

Image via Mediaite . Mediaite used its team of scientist to try and decipher this strange message that many theorize (actually probably just me) may have originated from an ancient extra-terrestrial right-wing alien entity. “Hey, liberal media. It was White House press secretary Josh Earnest who refused to answer the question: will Obama stay in the US if Donald Trump wins? I said I’d pay a charter to any country they chose . I mentioned Canada, where the satire piece was written , and Kenya, where he once visited. Also, I am in need of serious professional help.” By the way, the link that Hannity sent belongs to a site run by professional alt-right Twitter troll, Chuck Johnson, who was suspended from Twitter in May for threatening a civil rights activist. Since then Hannity has unfortunately deleted the gloriously “drunken tweet” in question. However, that didn’t stop the heartless, ruthless bastards on Twitter from trolling poor Hannity like there was no tomorrow. He's been possessed by Sarah Palin! https://t.co/k7N06DWfQK",

Referring to Trump’s victory in Tuesday’s presidential election, Biden said, “A number of my friends in the [Jewish] community are anxious about what it will mean for America’s commitment to Israel. I stand here to tell you that I have no doubt, none whatsoever, that in the Trump administration there will be no diminution of support as a consequence of this transition. Even if the new administration were inclined to reduce the commitment, which it is not, Congress would never let it happen; the American people would never let it happen.” Furthermore, Biden told the crowd, “You measure your influence on how well you influence me, presidents, vice presidents, secretaries, senators, congressmen. But your influence on the American community at large has been profound. That’s the ultimate guarantor that every American president, and every transition, will never dare, even if they’re inclined — and the Trump admin is not inclined — to reduce” US support for the Jewish state. Earlier in his remarks — given at an event at which he received the WJC’s Theodor Herzl award for his “contributions to the well-being of Israel and the Jewish people” — Biden equated anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism.",

However, there was some urgency required as first light began to break over the horizon and Obama, along with two aides, had yet to bury the modest box which contained the codes to all of America’s nuclear warhead missiles. “Just shout the safety word we agreed on if you see anyone coming, even if it’s Michelle, no one can know it’s here, maybe we can tell her where they are when she runs in 8 years time,” Obama said to a secret service official as his brow glistened with sweat. Now clawing at the earth in a frantic fashion with his bare hands fuelled by images of a tiny orange hand plunging its digits onto the ‘launch nuclear weapon’ button, the Democrat felt he could take no chances with the codes as Republican candidate Donald Trump was leading in some national polls. “Whose job is it to regularly water the grass here, I want his ass fired, it’s been hell digging here, it’s so hard and dry,” Obama added, unaware watering the White House lawns was the official duty of the president of the country. Finishing burying the box containing the codes, Obama used the shovel to dab down the freshly overturned soil before striking his aides over the back of the head with the digging tool. “No one can know where it’s buried, no one,” Obama added, as he dragged their unconscious bodies to another patch of White House lawn, whereby he set about digging two fresh holes.",

Loading Facebook Post... She says they carried on a small conversation and it was “super adorable.” Yet, when they said goodbye and went their separate ways, Norah realized she missed out on the opportunity to take a photo with her new friend. Tara turned around and tracked down the older gentleman — who they learned was named Mr. Dan — one more time. Loading Facebook Post...

Gladly we don’t live in the goldfish bowl of America where the constant news reportage has been beating down on the heads of Americans every second of the day with propaganda and ridiculous campaign advertising. One only has to look at the crowds of brainwashed citizens in stadiums waving their flags to see they are not all there, their eyes exhibit the same hypnotised ten thousand yard stare, their shrieks of support for whichever candidate a call to arms for other fellow lemmings to join their crusade. The decision for Hillary Clinton was set over a year ago, and the Daily Squib accurately predicted the final result. Again, we will be proven correct, and again, there will be no fanfare or acknowledgement for our accuracy, but that’s part of the game of being a maverick, separate from all the others, they’re doing the same old thing over and over again, we do not follow you, we are separate and unique. Dixville Notch, an eight vote for Clinton is the first as always, and so it shall go on, further results seeping in today and tomorrow. Let us all hope Trump crawls back under his rock after this and is never seen again.

Scientists at the Kent Institute of Pharmacology admitted that May, 47, had agreed to take part in a trial of an experimental new drug aimed at getting middle-aged men to ‘just grow up’. Unfortunately the drug had the undesired effect of making him grow to five storeys tall, from which height it is believed that May’s instinct ‘to treat everything like a giant train set’ kicked in. Whitstable was particularly badly hit when rush hour traffic was swept off the road by May’s huge hands so he could force Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond to race each other in two Robin Reliants made of lego. Eyewitness said he later tried to attach an electricity pylon to Clarkson’s car so he could play scaletrix but grew enraged when the wires tangled in his ample fringe, and threw Clarkson over a hill, before running off in the direction of Ashford. Despite a body count of 3000 and rising, residents of Kent are urged to remain calm, and to talk about cars as much as possible in the hope of creating a familiar and soothing background noise for the confused beast. They are also urged to protect their homes and vehicles by putting up the posters Oz Clarke being airdropped by the RAF across the county. Richard Hammond strenuously denied that this is yet another zany Top Gear stunt, claiming that ‘a giant James May wandering around causing mayhem really wouldn’t be that entertaining’. Jeremy Clarkson meanwhile hit back at Kent Council’s objection James May destroying the centre of Canterbury and killing thousands; ‘It’s just another example of the health and safety nanny state gone mad!’ Rhysickle",

November 2016 Studie: Lohnzahlungen verursachen Milliardenschäden für deutsche Unternehmen Hamburg (Archiv) - Schon lange haben Wirtschaftsverbände gewarnt, jetzt bestätigt eine unabhängige Studie den Verdacht: Lohnzahlungen an Arbeitnehmer fügen deutschen Unternehmen jährlich Schäden in Milliardenhöhe zu. Zu dieser Feststellung kam das Institut für Wirtschaftsökonomie in einer großangelegten Studie, in deren Zuge mehr als 3000 hiesige Betriebe und Unternehmen unter die Lupe genommen wurden. \"Die Zahlen sind alarmierend\", erklärt Ökonom Harald Glockner. \"In den letzten Jahren machten Lohnkosten im Schnitt zwei Drittel aller Unternehmensausgaben aus. Kaum vorzustellen, was für gigantische Gewinne gemacht werden könnten, wenn dieser lästige Posten nicht wäre.\" Schwächen die Wirtschaft mit ihrer Gier: Arbeitnehmer Vielen Beschäftigten sei weder bewusst, welchen enormen finanziellen Schaden sie ihrem Arbeitgeber durch ihre Löhne und Bezüge monatlich zufügen, noch dass sie damit letztlich gar ihren eigenen Arbeitsplatz gefährden. In diesem Klima des Egoismus sei es für viele Firmen schwer geworden, auch nur die allernötigsten Rekordrenditen an ihre Aktionäre auszuschütten. Angesichts der erschreckenden Ergebnisse der Studie fordert der Arbeitgeberverband nun einen flächendeckenden Höchstlohn für abhängig Beschäftigte. Andernfalls sei deutschlandweit mit Vorstandsprotesten und Chefstreiks zu rechnen. fed, dan, ssi; Idee: Tobias K.; Foto oben: © Kautz15 - Fotolia.com, Foto rechts: © Kurhan - Fotolia.com; Hinweis: Erstmals erschienen am 21.8.14 Artikel teilen:",

Bev Harris, a leading expert on voter fraud, filmed what she describes as “ the most devastating election theft mechanism yet found ,” that allows officials to change the results of the election. Infowars.com reports: Used in precincts all across the country, the software – deemed “the most devastating election theft mechanism yet found” – allows votes to be fractured and rounded up or down to sway the results for any candidate. RELATED CONTENT Democratic Party Leader Served Election Fraud Lawsuit According to Harris, a member of the non-partisan Black Box Voting investigative team, this latest discovery constitutes the “missing piece” that blows the lid off of wide-scale voter fraud. “It was put in the system in 2001 but it came into wide use in 2006,” Harris said. “It took someone with a special set of skills to know what to look for.” A mini-documentary by Black Box Voting on the discovery shows real-time demonstrations with the secretive software. “It can give contract signing authority to whoever the user chooses,” the video’s description states. “All political power can be converted to the hands of a few anonymous subcontractors.” “It runs silently, invisibly, and can produce plausible results that really pass for the real thing.” Further analysis on the malicious software provided by Alex Jones reveals how this revelation ties into the 2016 presidential election.",

A dispute ensued, and two off duty policemen became involved and the African American driver was shot to death. He reportedly was brandishing a gun. Crickets from the national media. Here we have a cop shooting a black man, and all of a sudden no one except local Chicago media wants to talk about it. Who called the dogs off on election night eve? Mt. Greenwood is an interesting neighborhood. Mostly ethnic Irish city workers. Cops, fireman, Streets and San (water department) etc. These are the best jobs in the metropolitan area for the blue collar workers, but they have to live in the city due to the residency requirement for Chicago workers.

A legislative committee will be reviewing an emergency request to borrow more money from the Bank of North Dakota to cover the cost of law enforcement’s involvement in the Dakota Access pipeline protests. The department has used an increasing amount of money since the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, which was supposed to be saved for natural disasters, but is now used to protect the pipeline that is planned to go through 1851 treaty land. To fight for companies behind the DAPL, officers from at least 6 states have been deployed. North Dakota is responsible for reimbursing out-of-state police agencies for costs that have to do with wages, overtime, officer benefits, meals while on duty, a per diem while off duty, lodging and mileage for the communities that sent vehicles. Governor Jack Dalrymple will vote on Tuesday, November 8th on whether to borrow $4 million from the state-owned bank. The panel has already borrowed and spent $6 million from the bank in September. North Dakota officials have also requested federal officials to reimburse the state for the additional law enforcement costs. All of this money going towards the police brings a lot into question. How much taxpayer money will be used to protect the investment of a company over investments on human health? How much money is given to law enforcement, military, and corporations in order to silence the people fighting for justice?  ",

While talking to Rolling Stone , the Oscar-winning director said that he made his movie in an attempt to convince undecideds that voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton isn’t a bad idea. And that Trump supporters will be hurting the country. “I want them to think about the damage they could do by being a legal terrorist on November 8,” Moore said. When Rolling Stone asked him to explain what a “legal terrorist” means and if it’s a catch-all for Trump voters, Moore responded: “Any. Legally, you have a right to vote on November 8. You can go in there and even though you’re not necessarily in favor of Trump and you don’t like him that much and you know he’s a little crazy, you also know he’s going to blow up the system.

Paul Parizek says officers charged 55-year-old Terri Rote with first-degree election misconduct on Thursday after being notified by elections officials that she had submitted two absentee ballots. The real bombshell comes in paragraph 3: According to an Iowa Public Radio report, Rote voted two times for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. After quoting Trump’s “oft-repeated line on the … campaign trail: ‘The polls are rigged,'” the CBS reporters note that Thursday’s development is not a one-off deal. They quote Polk County Attorney John Sarcone as saying, “This [is] maybe the third [time] we’ve had some irregularity that’s resulted in a criminal charge.” From there, the writers go on to express their newfound support of voter ID laws, adding that Republicans have been right all along and some method for keeping elections honest is long overdue. Oh, wait a seond: No they don’t. That would be the logical conclusion, but since when are liberals capable of logical thought? 1 shares",

The Lafayette Police Department is being evicted from Desco Plaza because there are not enough parking spots for all of their police cruisers. According to city manager Steven Falk, the overbearing presence of cruisers is impacting tenants in the building, affecting their ability to park their own vehicles. In a council meeting earlier this week, Blomstrand referenced “a growing force and too many police cars crammed into his property” as reasons for evicting the department. Each tenant gets ten parking spaces, but the department is using forty. Desco Plaza owner Curt Blomstrand has told the department that it must leave as soon as its lease ends at the end of the year.

        "content": "Afghan Officials Say Taliban Used Locals as 'Human Shields'   Hundreds of angry mourners gathered today in the north Afghan village of Bouz Kandahari to bury an estimated 30 civilian victims of a US airstrike the previous day. The locals noted that many of the civilians being buried were infants and small children. Two US soldiers and four Afghan soldiers were killed in fighting with the Taliban near the village Thursday morning, and the airstrikes were called in, supposedly in an attempt to break the Taliban siege against the village. Instead, the airstrikes hit the village, destroying several homes and killing those within. NATO promised an investigation into the details of the matter, but Afghan officials appeared to be shrugging the matter off, insisting the Taliban were using the locals as “human shields” by virtue of their operating somewhat near their homes. US statements on the fighting and airstrikes have more or less ignored the civilian toll entirely, insisting only that they take such reports “seriously,” and then going into details about the condolences they offer for the US soldiers killed in the fighting. Bouz Kandahari is near the city of Kunduz, which was taken over briefly last year by the Taliban. The Taliban has been advancing in the area in recent weeks, along with offensives against the capitals of two other provinces, Helmand and Uruzgan.  ",

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Sunrise, Fla. With the 2016 election campaign winding down, the Clinton campaign is ratcheting up demands for the FBI to publicly confirm the campaign’s allegations that Republican nominee Donald Trump is secretly in league with Russia. Sen. Harry Reid (D – NV) went so far as to claim the FBI has secret “explosive” evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government that it is withholding. FBI officials familiar with their investigations into the allegations, which the Clinton campaign started publicizing around the Democratic National Convention, say they’ve turned up nothing to connect Trump and Russia , leading FBI Director James Comey to decide against making any statements to that effect. The Clinton campaign has been making the allegations so long that they have taken to claiming “everyone knows” that they are true, and appears unsettled by the FBI’s refusal to sign off on the claims simply because they haven’t been able to find real evidence corroborating the story. The Trump campaign has repeatedly denied ties to Russia, but that didn’t stop Clinton from calling Trump a “puppet” of Russian President Vladimir Putin during the final presidential debate. The calls have grown since Friday’s FBI report to Congress about further Clinton emails being sought. With Clinton’s main campaign scandal growing in the waning weeks of the deal, some in her campaign have suggested that affirming Trump as secretly in league with the Russians would only be fair. Absent any evidence, however, it appears that won’t be happening. This article originally appeared on Antiwar.com. Be Sociable, Share!",

        "content": "No Sign US Is Going to Slow Arms Sales to Saudis   After a solid 19 months of endorsing the Saudi war in Yemen, selling the Saudis massive amounts of arms, and refueling Saudi bombers over Yemen’s airspace, the Obama Administration today called on the Saudis to halt airstrikes against Yemen, and accept that there is no military solution. A top Human Rights Watch director noted that the call would’ve carried a lot more weight if the US wasn’t providing the bombs the Saudis are dropping on Yemen in the first place, though former US officials say its almost certain this won’t include any dial back in US arms sales. The call likely reflects the UN’s peace plan being presented to both sides and immediately rejected by the pro-Saudi officials. Huge civilian death tolls in recent Saudi attacks have added up to make the US a bit more gunshy than usual about supporting the Saudi war publicly. At the same time, the US “opposition” to the air war is slim indeed, with the US Ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, insisting even in the announcement of their opposition to further strikes that the US supports Saudi Arabia’s right to “self-defense,” which in this case included an outright invasion of a neighboring country. The US has insisted Saudi aid is “under review” since a recent attack on a funeral. That said, there is no sign that any real changes in US policy were made, and the expectation is that, as always, US interest in growing arms exports will win out.  ",

        "content": "Why Iranian-American pastor held hostage in Iran is voting for Donald Trump Iranian-American Pastor Saeed Abedini is brimming with gratitude for one U.S. presidential aspirant: Donald Trump. Christian Today In a surprising revelation, Abedini said the Republican presidential nominee helped provide for the needs of his family in Boise, Idaho while he was locked up in an Iranian prison for his faith. The pastor said Trump gave his family $10,000 while he was imprisoned for three and a half years. “I am finally free in a free country. Last year on the same day I was sick and in chains for Christ, and now I can vote to choose my next president,” Abedini said in a post on his Facebook page on Sunday. “And most amazingly, I can vote for someone that I know fought for me and called my name so many times. He met my family and gave them a $10,000 gift. I think his ideas are more biblical than the other candidates,” he added. In contrast, Abedini said Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton did not do or say anything to help secure his release from Iranian prison. The pastor said Clinton never spoke his name or met his family. Abedini family As a woman who says she stands for women’s rights when she was foreign minister, she never contacted my mom, wife, sister or my daughter. She never did anything to help when I was in prison as an American pastor who was detained in Iran as a hostage,” he wrote. (Probably because she was too busy figuring out how to get more Iranian Muslims into the country) Last week, Abedini said he already cast an early vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election.",

        "content": "In a major omen of potential election disaster for Republicans, Donald Trump has scored the lowest rating in the history of Gallup’s presidential leadership poll. Gallup released their presidential leadership survey, and the results were historically bad for Donald Trump: Voters rate Trump worse than any other presidential candidate in Gallup’s records on having the personality and leadership qualities a president should have. Previous readings were taken in late October in the 2000, 2004 and 2008 campaigns. In those years, between 52% and 61% of registered voters said the two major-party candidates had the right personality and leadership qualities — a sharp contrast to Trump’s current 32%. Clinton’s rating of 51% is one percentage point below the previous low score. Clinton’s score, while low, was one point of the range for previous presidential cycles going back to 2000. Trump’s score was twenty percent below the lowest score in the history of the poll. Voters aren’t going to elect a man to be the next president who they view as lacking the basic qualities of presidential leadership. The popular vote total in 2016 may reflect the nation’s political polarization, but there is a reason why electoral map projections continue to look very good for the Democratic candidate. Donald Trump has failed the most elemental test for any presidential candidate. He doesn’t look, act, or behave like a person who has the qualities needed to occupy the Oval Office and lead the United States of America. The last week before election day tension that is in the air is normal, but the fundamental motivating factors of this contest haven’t changed. Democrats are holding on to their electoral map advantage, while Donald Trump has become the central issue and question on the ballot. Republicans look to be heading for a major ballot box disaster because voters do not believe that Donald Trump is fit to be president.",

        "content": "Attacks Ramp Up Ahead of Russia's New Ceasefire by Jason Ditz, November 03, 2016 Share This A coalition of Syrian rebels led by the Nusra Front have been attacking government-held Western Aleppo since Friday, and escalated the strikes ahead of Russia’s new ceasefire. Reports out of the city suggest heavy firing against government-held neighborhoods. While details are still emerging, 12 civilians were reported slain in the firing, and around 200 others were wounded . This toll is independent of the toll from fighting on the ground between rebels and military forces, for which no official figures have yet been released. The Russian ceasefire is intended to offer a 10-hour window during which the rebels can leave the city freely through two corridors, taking their weapons and anything else with them, though the rebels have already denounced both the offer and the ceasefire, insisting they will never surrender the city. Both sides have been trading fire for months, often shelling one another’s neighborhoods, attacks which tend to kill a lot more civilian bystanders than combatants. They also trade offensives and counteroffensives, aiming to take control of the entire city. So far, neither side has been able to get serious gains in the fighting over the city. Some smaller gains by the Syrian military last month appear to be getting reversed with this new offensive by the rebels from outside the city. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",

The vice admiral claimed the US “knows” both where the ships came from and where they were going because they interviewed the crews of the captured ships. Only one of the four putative weapons ships was validated by the United Nations as being an actual smuggling attempt. Donegan went on to claim that he believes Iran is “connected in some way” to recent incidents of missiles fired at a US ship off the Yemeni coast, though the Pentagon conceded one of those incidents likely never happened, and he offered no evidence of Iranian involvement in anything else. The allegations were likely made by way of justifying US attacks on the Yemeni coast, as well as justifying Saudi Arabia’s ongoing naval blockade of Yemen, which Saudi Arabia recently denied is happening.

Um die ewigen Streitereien um den Ruhestand ein für allemal zu beenden, hat Andrea Nahles (SPD) heute einen neuen Vorstoß gewagt und die sogenannte \"Rente zwölf Jahre vor dem Tod\" vorgestellt. Der Ansatz sieht vor, dass Arbeitnehmer unabhängig vom eigenen Alter künftig genau zwölf Jahre vor ihrem Ableben Anspruch auf die volle Rente haben. Denn nur auf diesem Wege könnten die unterschiedlichen Biographien von Arbeitnehmern berücksichtigt werden. Hat die Rentenfrage endlich gelöst: Nahles Auf einer Pressekonferenz führte Nahles ihre Pläne genauer aus: \"Ein Sparkassenangestellter, der erst mit 97 stirbt, müsste künftig bis 85 arbeiten, während etwa ein Maurer, der mit 44 bei einem Motorradunfall ums Leben kommt, schon mit 32 in den Ruhestand gehen könnte – bei voller Leistung. Nur so kann volle Rentengerechtigkeit hergestellt werden.\" Gewerkschaften und Arbeitgeberverbände reagierten enttäuscht auf den Entwurf aus dem Arbeitsministerium. Erstere fordern, dass die Rente bereits 14 Jahre vor dem Tod ausbezahlt werden sollte, während zweitere aufgrund des demographischen Wandels die Rente erst zehn Jahre vor dem Tod durchsetzen wollen. Nahles selbst trat nach der Pressekonferenz umgehend von ihrem Amt zurück. Aufgrund einer unheilbaren Krebserkrankung, an der sie in zwölf Jahren sterben werde, wolle sie jetzt erst einmal den wohlverdienten Ruhestand im Kreise ihrer Liebsten genießen. ssi; Foto oben: Fotolia.com, Foto rechts: Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung , CC BY-SA 2.0 ; Hinweis: Erstmals erschienen am 12.8.10 Artikel teilen:",

Maryland Trump Supporter: They Switched My Vote to Hillary – https://t.co/FkNiEUOZHH pic.twitter.com/dalY9KBWtj — Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) October 28, 2016 Noting that she had seen reports on the news of votes being flipped, the woman said, “I went in and voted a straight Republican ticket and thank God I went back and checked and they had switched my vote from Trump to (Hillary).” She said that she had to get the vote changed back by alerting election officials, who simply told her to vote for a second time. “I went back the second time and made sure they didn’t change it,” she concluded. As we reported earlier this week, voters in numerous areas of Texas have made a series of complaints that votes are being switched from Trump to Clinton. One election official responded by claiming the problems were caused by voters not understanding how to use the machines properly. “Typically, we’ve found it’s voter error with the equipment,” Frank Phillips, Tarrant County’s election administrator, told WFAA . “Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates … or do something with the wheel….There is not an issue with the equipment.” However, Trump supporters continue to point to the reports as evidence that vote fraud may be taking place.

Is is the same questions? You get the same questions again and again and again?” asks Lewis. “I’m an idiot. Really. I’m the dumbest guy that you’ve ever met in your whole life” replies Johnson. An awkward silence follows while Lewis admits “I’m trying to work out if that’s sarcasm or not.” When Lews got to more substantial questions, like how Johnson felt about the fact that every major economist considers Johnson’s proposals to abolish all taxes and replace them with a flat sales tax to be crackpot lunacy, the candidate blew his top and went off on an angry but unrelated rant about how he was considered a fool for proposing marijuana legalization. The Libertarian Party never had much chance in the first place, and their poll numbers continue to plummet . Their platform of free-market anarchy and a juvenile obsession with “freedoms” is supported largely by stoned fringe wing-nuts who worship Alex Jones and despise the government in the same way a toddler is infuriated at a parent for not letting them jam a fork into an electric socket. The general displeasure with the mainstream candidates created some increased interest in the Libertarian Party, but Gary Johnson’s behavior can be seen as a representation for the party as a whole: unprepared and immature.

On Tuesday night a heckler interrupted her speech, waving a sign that read “Bill Clinton is a rapist.” Her response, instead of showing her usual controlled aplomb and restraint, surprised the crowd at its intensity and ferocity. Pointing at the offender and shouting at the top of her voice, Clinton exploded: I’m sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior of people who support Donald Trump! The protestor was immediately led away and his sign was torn apart. It turned out that the protestor was vying for a cash prize being offered by Alex Jones of InfoWars.com to anyone appearing either on television or at a Clinton rally chanting “Bill Clinton is a rapist” and wearing a t-shirt bearing the same slogan. NBC News tried to downplay the interruption, noting that while other protestors have shown up at rallies featuring President Obama and Bill Clinton himself, they are bringing attention to “decades-old allegations from three women who accuse Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct. The former president has denied all of the allegations.” Post navigation",

A Mexican official has filed a criminal tax complaint against Trump in Tijuana, Mexico, over yet another failed business venture – the Trump Ocean Resort, which collapsed before it even began construction. But before the housing market and the rest of the global economy collapsed with the onset of the Bush Recession, Trump and his partners sold $32.5 million in future properties to unwitting customers since 2006 and leaving their investors in the lurch. In addition, Donald Trump is accused of dodging an additional $32.5 million in taxes – surprise! – but has countered that he wasn’t actually involved, but that he was just “leasing” his name on the project. The investors, however, counter that Trump’s face was on the brochure and quoted him as saying it would be “the most spectacular place in all of Mexico.” Though Trump worked out the deal with Los Angeles-based developer Irongate Wilshire and Mexican company P.B. Impulsores, the lawsuit singles out Trump by name, calling him out “against the Mexican state because beyond defrauding investors he also committed fraud by not paying taxes in Mexico for the mercantile operations he took part in.”",

По данным Пентагона, аль-Катани являлся «эмиром»«Аль-Каиды»* на северо-востоке Афганистана и вместе с аль-Утаби занимался воссозданием баз организации в стране, а также вербовкой и обучением иностранных боевиков.

He faulted how the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, handled new emails related to the investigation into Mrs. Clinton’s private server, and then shouted out to college students here in a pivotal battleground state that it was crucial that they vote because the “fate of the world is teetering.” Mr. Obama’s comments about Mr. Comey, broadcast early in the day as recent polls showed a tightening race, were striking for a president who has insisted he does not comment on F.B.I. investigations. But Mr. Obama appeared to be doing exactly that in implicitly criticizing Mr. Comey’s decision to send a vague letter last week to Congress — and by extension, the public — informing lawmakers about a discovery of new emails related to Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private server as secretary of state. “We don’t operate on incomplete information,” Mr. Obama said in an interview with NowThis News. “We don’t operate on leaks. We operate based on concrete decisions that are made.”",

In an interview published Monday with The Washington Post, Sanders argued that the Democratic Party is “more progressive” than its presidential nominee. He emphasized that he saw it as his role to “demand that the Democratic Party implement” the party platform his allies helped shape, and would be “vigorously in opposition” if Clinton attempted to abandon the platform’s progressive elements. “The leverage that I think I take into the Senate is taking on the entire Democratic Party establishment, and, you know, taking on a very powerful political organization with the Clinton people,” Sanders said. He then referenced the number of states he won during the primary, 22. “That gives me a lot of leverage, leverage that I intend to use,” he added. The Vermont senator also emphasized that he would not be cowed by the knowledge that his proposals would not be well received by a likely Republican-controlled House of Representatives.",

The units include mental health professionals and focus on deescalation of conflicts.In the same segment, Springer addresses the irony of hip hop being used to justify the dehumanization of black people. It should be a liberation art, especially as it’s built to humanize people, but it doesn’t always work that way.Springer adds, “Protesting can feel like prayer, but it also feels like pain and trauma.” And, “There’s nothing glamorous about protest.”Activists must practice self care. For Springer, that means going to prayer services regularly and sometimes sitting quietly with tea.Roqayah’s “Islam In America” series is an ongoing project, which amplifies the stories of American Muslims and what they struggle with in their day-to-day lives beyond just Islamophobia.

The deal came out of Cocco Bello’s participation in the Lipton Goodstarter project, a platform created to support young socially beneficial companies. As part of the initiative, Cocco Bello received a 300,000 rubles ($4,800) investment from Lipton. \"Since we have won the Lipton contest, we decided to offer them the cooperation,\" said Guzel Sanzhapova, 28, the startup’s founder. Sanzhapova began the project as a family operation in 2013. “Today we have nine employees and most of them are seniors,” Sanzhapova said. The company’s main products are honey, herbal tea and candies. Sanzhapova is now making plans to build her own candy factory and hopes to attract investment through crowdfunding. She estimates the total cost of construction at about 6 million rubles ($95,500). She has already collected 938,000 rubles ($15,000). Lipton’s press service told RBTH that the Lipton program helps identify companies that have missions that fit well with the Lipton brand. According to the press service, a joint product between Lipton and Cocco Bello will go on sale as soon as official partner contract negotiations are concluded. “This is high speed for Unilever,” the press service said.

He's arrogant, dumb and brimming with bright ideas like just giving Iran money or splitting Iraq into little pieces. Obviously this wouldn't be a competency pick. The last time we had someone qualified as Secretary of State was during President Bush's time in office. Then Democrats decided they would give the job as a consolation prize to failed presidential candidates. Because our foreign policy is just that important. And who could be counted on to make an even bigger mess than Hillary Clinton or John Kerry... Joe Biden. It's a perfect plan. If you want a fall guy to blame everything on, they don't come any more obvious than Joe Biden. And if you want someone shadowed by the soft bigotry of low expectations, you've gotta go Joe. Joe Biden could accidentally start WW3 and everyone would shrug and say, \"That's just Joe.\"",

Reputable news publications originally reported the claim as fact, but have since taken down their misinformed story without a correction, which said the cat was ‘targeted by unknown individuals who strapped a firework to its mouth, killing it’. Pictures of the dead cat were then circulated online for maximum effect. However, a post-mortem this morning has revealed the cat was in fact killed in a hit and run incident – a conclusion backed up by Gardaí, who reviewed CCTV of the incident which revealed the cat was struck by a car. “Too be honest, I do be too skagged out of me head to be chasin’ cats and wasting heroin money on fireworks,” Clonmel teen Martin Dunphy told WWN today, “T’was gas how quick all de straight heads pointed the finger at us, and then it turns out it was one of their own drivin’ a car. We demand an apology… or a few euro for the bus if ye have it?” Clonmel gardaí have since closed the investigation, despite the driver of the vehicle being at large in the area, sparking conspiracy claims around the town. “It’s one law for us, and another for them,” voiced another teenager, “If they can do this to an animal, the worry is what they’ll do to a person”. Since the revelation, youth campaigners have set up a Facebook page, Cats Lives Matter, calling for justice for the animal, urging gardaí to relaunch a full investigation into the “hit and run”.",

I am not privy, of course, to the inner workings of Hillary Clinton’s world. In fact, very few people are, considering that Clinton isn’t exactly ruler of the Principality of Transparencyland. However, given her history, I find that it’s usually safe to assume the worst when it comes to her. It’s not that we’ve been lied to yet again. If I got angry every time Hillary Clinton lied to us, my blood pressure could run a hydroelectric power plant. It’s that she lied so cravenly about an issue that affects our national security . And she wants to take this mentality to 1600 Pennsylvania? Give me a break. Advertisement - story continues below",

The Republican position, as restated here by Kirk, is that it’s okay to come from another country as long as you’re white. Neither Kirk nor his campaign has apologized. Kirk has said Trump should quit over his misogynist comments; apparently, it’s okay to make racist comments. When Duckworth said her family had served since the American Revolution, she wasn’t joking, and she set Kirk straight in a tweet : My mom is an immigrant and my dad and his family have served this nation in uniform since the Revolution #ILSEN pic.twitter.com/ehEBHswFMs — Tammy Duckworth (@TammyforIL) October 28, 2016 The Illinois senator has unendorsed Donald Trump, one malignant clown calling another a malignant clown , and this latest move has given Kellyanne Conway a rare opportunity to gloat, tweeting , The same Mark Kirk that unendorsed his party's presidential nominee and called him out in paid ads?

From the beginning of 2015 through last March, the Denver Sheriff Department went on a major hiring binge, adding more than 200 new deputies. But those jobs ended up only going to citizens, because the department made citizenship a stated requirement on the job application . The department admitted as much in a new settlement with the U.S. government, which requires it to pay a $10,000 fine. The department will also have to comb through all of its job applications from the past two years, identifying immigrants who were excluded from the hiring process and giving them due consideration. How can someone be hired to enforce the law, if they are living in violation and ignorance of it?How can counties, state agencies, small businesses or individuals be forced to hire in violation of the law, in order to comply with non-discrimination?Obviously the system has a logical loop failure, either that, or someone wants this country to eat itself.Read more: Outrage: Border Patrol Ordered To Release All Illegal Alien Drunk Drivers: “Allow Them to Go On Their Way” Watch: How Liberals React When Asked to House An Illegal Immigrant Child In Their Homes Immigration End Game Revealed: New Law Would Give Illegal Immigrants The Right To Vote, Collect Government Benefits Urged by Obama, Illegal Immigrants Line Up to Vote Against Trump: “Donald Trump Never!” ",

Her own campaign, in two separate events shown in the video below, show her complete hypocrisy, dirty dealings and illegal actions to suppress Republican voters. But what’s even worse is that for as much as Hillary attacked Trump’s comments released on video from a decade ago , getting her media attack dogs to go after him full force, her own people do exactly the same thing. And Project Veritas has brought us the proof. From Political Insider: It’s official! Hillary Clinton and her campaign just had their own “locker room moment.” Watch (below) as this hidden camera video from Project Veritas shows Hillary Clinton campaign field organizer Wylie Mao, laughing and bragging about being able to grab a “co-worker’s” ass and not get fired. The video was filmed of Mao at a bar in West Palm Beach, and he explained just how acceptable harassment is on Hillary Clinton’s campaign. WARNING: Contains adult language and content.

Image Credit: Taylor Hill/Getty Images What makes this extra special is that the CMAs are celebrating their 50th anniversary. Despite the award show being so close to the 2016 presidential election, Underwood recently expressed that she doesn't want to talk about politics as one of the night's hosts. The singer tells The Boot she wants the 50th anniversary of the CMAS to stay focused on what they're there to celebrate— the music: “I prefer to stay away from politics. This is country music, and we have 50 years to cover. So I feel like we’ll have lots to talk about, but I think it will be more geared to just us and what we do and all these legends that we have and people that have incredible talent that we have in our genre.” While we don't know if Paisley got Underwood's memo, we do know that he's already up to the duo's usual shenanigans . A few days ago, the singer encouraged everyone to vote for their favorite candidate. The singer made his choice clear with his shirt... A video posted by Brad Paisley (@bradpaisley) on Oct 21, 2016 at 1:56pm PDT Paisley's caption reads: “This November, be sure to vote for your favorite nominee... whoever that is...” The shirt is actually inspired by the Netflix series, “House of Cards.” The main character is named Frank Underwood, which also works nicely for joking around with Carrie Underwood.

It has voted for a Democrat in the last four Presidential elections. It has a Democrat Congressman and will likely be the most expensive Congressional race this year. Usually, a Democrat Presidential candidate would win. But a recent poll held a shock: Donald Trump is up 12 points! And more: Trump is winning among women. And the Democrat Party is losing members. They’re becoming Independents. What The Data Says did this analysis of the Eighth Congressional District of Minnesota: – Trump is beating Hillary by 12 points: “Our poll shows Republican Donald Trump with a 12-point lead over Clinton, 47 percent to 35 percent“ – Trump is winning with women: “leading Clinton 41 percent to 39 percent.” – Dems are crossing over: “the number of Democrats dropped from 34 percent in 2014 to 27 percent in 2016.

Young’s basic thesis is that, if someone as, umm, let’s say immoderate, as Trump could get elected President (in part as an anti-PC champion, no less), it would validate the PC belief that “crude xenophobia” and “toxic masculinity” really are pervasive problems. [ Why Electing Donald Trump Could Make Political Correctness Worse , November 7, 2016] And so the PC crowd would double-down even further. I think this is a good analysis. Of course, Young’s implicit assumption is that increasing political polarization is a problem that can be solved, that a center-Right, classical liberal consensus is the goal. But the time for that has passed. So kudos to Young for identifying the problem, but we need a new solution—such as Michael Hart’s proposal for the peaceful secession of Red State America.",

Our eyes were designed to receive the light frequency of the Sun. Rays strike the optic nerve, which signals the pituitary gland, triggering the release of hormones and neurotransmitters that regulate our bodily functions. The mitochondria of each cell in the human body produce almost one’s entire bodyweight in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per day (!) and the human body can only live for 15 seconds without it, as compared to 4-10 minutes without air, 3-4 days without water. Another shocking thing we learn is that we only receive 1/3rd of what is converted into ATP from the food we eat. The overwhelming percentage of our ATP production comes from the light we receive through our eyes and skin. With many of us staring at screen devices or spending most of our time indoors with energy-saving LED lighting, few of us are aware of the adverse effects that LEDs have on retinal health, hormonal health and mental health, because these do not emit the correct frequency of light, in order for us to produce ATP.

Clinton frequently has expected free, luxurious private jet travel during his post-presidential life. Clinton, his wife and daughter have artfully secured free air travel and luxurious accommodations since they left the White House. It’s an effective way to accept gifts of great value without declaring them for the Clinton Foundation. “It’s highly illegal and it’s likely that the owners of these aircraft took tax deductions as a gift to the Clinton Foundation,” Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst and critic of the Clinton Foundation, told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Norwegian Government to Deport White Patriot While Nation is Swamped by Tens of Thousands of Non-White Invaders By 0 129 Seven policemen searched Norwegian Nordic Resistance Movement member Ronny Bårdsen’s apartment to find the Norwegian-Russian nationalist Yan Petrovskiy (also knnown as Veliki Slavian; pictured). He will be deported from Norway. The police informed Petrovskiy that he has two days to get a flight ticket and five to leave the country. The police wanted to see Petrovskiy’s passport and know if he accepts the decision and leaves Norway voluntarily or if he has to be forced. Petrovskiy answered that according to the advice of his lawyer, Nils Christian Nordhus, he doesn’t keep the passport in his apartment, and he will talk with his lawyer before giving an answer concerning his departure. After this Petrovskiy attempted to call his lawyer while the police were waiting, but because his lawyer didn’t pick it up, the police decided to arrest Petrovskiy and search Bårdsen’s apartment. Petrovskiy has lived in the address for some time and has been registered as a Norwegian resident. The real reason behind the search was to acquire Petrovskiy’s passport, as without it he cannot be deported. Despite the efforts of the police, the passport was not uncovered. The decision about the deportation was made by the Directorate of Immigration (Utlendingsdirektoratet) after the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) sent a letter to the directorate. In the letter PST stated that Petrovskiy was “a threat to national security.” The police — in Norway, Rotherham, or anywhere…",

        "content": "Warns Russia Can't Maintain Pause if Strikes Continue by Jason Ditz, November 01, 2016 Share This Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned today that the moratorium on Russian airstrikes around Aleppo is in jeopardy from the continued rebel attacks against positions around government-held Western Aleppo. Peskov insisted Russia wants to enable to exit of civilians from rebel Eastern Aleppo, and to create conditions wherein humanitarian aid can be delivered to the city. Russia has paused its airstrikes for about two weeks now to that end. While it seemed early on that Russia could afford to be patient, with Eastern Aleppo surrounded and the Syrian military doing well in clashes with the Nusra Front. Late last week, however, Nusra and their allies launched a major counterattack, which has been raging since. The counterattack came from outside the city, trying to end the siege on the east and threatening government-held territories in the west. Russia has so far not gotten involved, and while the Syrian military seems to have staved off any huge defeats, this likely adds to pressure from Russia’s Defense Ministry. Though President Putin has so far insisted the pause should continue, the defense ministry has made much of calling for an end to it and resuming airstrikes. It is unusual for them to publicly dissent from official policy, and the pick-up in fighting will only increase those calls. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",

        "content": "Share on Twitter With just 12 days until Election Day, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and wife, Melania, sat down to discuss the campaign's “best and worst moments” on “Good Morning America.” Journalist George Stephanopoulos began by asking Melania if she's still confident in her husband winning the race to the White House: “I see the connection with the American people and my husband, and he created a movement. The crowd and the people that are behind him are unbelievable to see.” But when Stephanopoulos questioned whether she'd physically get out there on the campaign trail and stump for Trump, she wasn't as confident: “We will see. My priority is my son Barron and I support [my husband] 100% and I’m there for him every time he needs me.” Trump was quick to interject, saying Melania would actually give two or three speeches soon, something that seemed to be news to Melania: Image Credit: Screenshot/ ABC News Trump explained that her speeches would be “big” and “important”: “She’s amazing when she speaks. She is an amazing public speaker. She’s agreed to do two or three speeches, and I think it’s going to be big speeches, important speeches.” It's understandable if Melania isn't eager to give speeches on the campaign trail, given what happened at the Republican National Convention in July. Trump's wife was publicly ripped apart after journalist Jarrett Hill pointed out the similarities between her speech and Michelle Obama's in 2008. Though a side-by-side video comparison showed how certain passages were identical, Melania said she wrote the speech herself...with a little help from Hillary Clinton's former speechwriter. Despite the controversy, however, many commended her speech as “beautiful” and given “with tremendous poise”— reflecting skills Trump's campaign may benefit from in these next two weeks. ",

Though he lost the boxing match, he still earned millions of dollars in the ‘fight of the century’ and felt it was his duty to give back.He wrote: “As faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms, each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others. I’m still building more because I always believe what the bible says offer hospitality to one another without grumbling.”The act of compassion could be nothing more than a calculated political move, but nonetheless, 1,000 families have secure living spaces thanks to the Senator’s generosity.

The opportunity will help clear the remaining refugees from the ‘Calais Jungle’, while French authorities continue to demolish it from existence, like a red wine stain from a woollen rug. It is understood the children will begin a series of in-house training courses before taking to the Apple floor to make phones, iPads and MacBook computers. “I have always loved Apple’s sleek product design,” 9-year-old Hafez Mohammed, who was born in the same week as the first ever iPhone release, “I cannot wait to start work making such cool products with them as my father and mother are missing and I have no idea where they are”. Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was more than happy to offer the children this fantastic opportunity as founder Steve Jobs was also Syrian, and believes he would have only been delighted to help out his fellow countrymen and women get through this difficult period of their lives. “Who knows, we may have the next Jobs in one of the 1,500 new employees,” Cook told WWN. The Apple offer could not have come at a better time as British Prime Minister May rejected a personal demand from Francois Hollande for Britain to accept 1,500 child migrants yesterday, leaving only child sex traffickers to pick up the tab.",

In addition, the networks spent far more airtime focusing on the personal controversies involving Trump (440 minutes) than about similar controversies involving Clinton (185 minutes). Donald Trumpâs treatment of women was given 102 minutes of evening news airtime, more than that allocated to discussing Clintonâs e-mail scandal (53 minutes) and the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play scandals (40 minutes) combined. For this study, the MRC analyzed all 588 evening news stories that either discussed or mentioned the presidential campaign on the ABC, CBS and NBC evening newscasts from July 29 through October 20 (including weekends). The networks devoted 1,191 minutes to the presidential campaign during this period, or nearly 29 percent of all news coverage. I would say something about how if Trump loses, the Jews are going to be blamed. But now, there is not really any chance whatsoever that Trump is going to lose.

There’s no evidence to support the Republican nominee’s claims of election fraud, but some cities are moving to expand voting rights to include noncitizens. The latest is San Francisco, where the Nov. 8 ballot will include a measure allowing the parents or legal guardians of any student in the city’s public schools to vote in school board elections. The right would be extended to those with green cards, visas, or no documentation at all. “One out of three kids in the San Francisco unified school system has a parent who is an immigrant, who is disenfranchised and doesn’t have a voice,” says San Francisco Assemblyman David Chiu, the son of Taiwanese immigrants. “We’ve had legal immigrants who’ve had children go through the entire K-12 system without having a say.” Undocumented immigrants should also have the right, Chiu adds, to bypass the “broken immigration system in this country.”",

A working paper produced in September 2015 by John Hamre, the policy board chairman, called for an immediate resumption of Navy warship passages to prevent China from taking over the strategic Southeast Asian waterway. The internal document was disclosed Monday by WikiLeaks as part of its latest batch of hacked emails from the account of John Podesta, campaign chairman for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. The Obama administration has accused “Russia’s senior-most officials” of hacking and leaking the emails posted to WikiLeaks and other sites in order to influence the 2016 election. The document was labeled “Chairman’s Working Notes of the Defense Policy Board – Chinese Island-Building in the South China Sea.” It was sent to Jake Sullivan, the Clinton campaign’s senior policy adviser, by Stuart Eizenstat, a Defense Policy Board member who was advising the campaign on internal Pentagon deliberations.

LONDON – England – When it comes to low information voters who do not have much knowledge of what they are voting for, or the EU, Remain voters and supporters fit the bill very succinctly. These Remain people are more concerned about roaming charges on their mobile phones in the continent than any serious issues that the EU is forcing on Britain. Brainwashed Remain voters are easily led sheep who would willingly go over a cliff because of their entrenched EU programming and their devout hatred of Britain. Jean Claude Juncker’s EU army is already on a roll, and the Remain supporters are unknowingly bringing forth this fascistic monster into plain sight. Not only is an EU army a threat to NATO but is seen as a direct threat by Russia right on their doorstep. By staying in the EU, the UK’s armed forces would be forced to cede control to a Brussels high command. The EU army already has an advanced control structure developed and is ready to go to the next level where all EU nations would be forced to commit their armed forces under a single EU military force. So when your sons and daughters are called up to have their limbs blown off on the battlefield, you can stop your Remoaning — you fully supported remaining in the EU. Share on :",

A March 2015 email revealed Podesta attended a meeting with Clinton campaign General Counsel, the lobbying firm Dewey Square Partners and Clinton Super PACs. Several emails released by WikiLeaks suggest the Clinton campaign illegally coordinated with Super PACs, prompting Clinton loyalist Neera Tanden to say she thought that what the campaign was doing with Correct the Record was “skirting, if not violating” the law. Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik tipped off Podesta and the Clinton campaign about what was going on at the Department of Justice. Kadzik, a friend of Podesta, will oversee the DOJ probe into Clinton aide Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner’s emails from Clinton’s private email server. “There is a HJC oversight hearing today where the head of our Civil Division will testify. Likely to get questions on State Department emails. Another filing in the FOIA case went in last night or will go in this am that indicates it will be awhile (2016) before the State Department posts the emails,” Kadzik wrote to Podesta in May 2015. Podesta forwarded the email to several top Clinton staffers. The email suggests the Department of Justice was biased in favor of Hillary Clinton , and Kadzik tip to Podesta was highly unethical.

On Friday the FBI chose to continue its investigation into Hillary Clinton’s unauthorized, unsecured email server stored in a bathroom closet and used to conduct official state business. Furthermore, the New York Times reported that the FBI had seized devices from top Clinton aide Huma Abedin’s estranged husband, disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner, while they investigated his sexting of an underage girl. One official said the new emails related to Clinton’s case numbered “in the tens of thousands.” Weiner’s penchant for sexting underage girls and sending them sexually explicit photos of himself now endangers Clinton’s presidential run. Trump hammered Weiner for years before his presidential run, calling him “degenerate” and “sick.” Trump also warned underage girls against Weiner back in 2012 and 2013, years before news broke that Weiner had sexually explicit texts and Skype calls with a 15-year-old girl.

Mark Blyth was virtually the only person to call a Trump victory virtually from the get-go (a colleague who spends a lot of time outside the Acela corridor is another member of that club) but also correctly gamed out how the stock market would react. Everything Blyth says is incisive, colorful, and on the mark. By contrast, it’s frustrating listening to Schiller because she is invested in way too much of the Dem orthodoxy, such as the Hillary scandals were manufactured by Republicans, that Sanders would have lost if he were the Democratic candidate, that Clinton was a victim of being a woman with a long political career (hello?). Similarly, towards the end, Blyth says, “There is no left left,” and explains why, and then Schiller begs to differ by trying to depict the Democrats as leftist. But she does have some random insightful remarks. In other words, you can run the video and tune your attention in and out, although you may then want to go back and listen to just the Mark Blyth remarks a second time.

We’ll explore how this was done, along with some new twists. The criticism and self-criticism technique in history The technique of “criticism and self-criticism” (kritika i samokritika) was developed during the early days of the Soviet Union. This got results. When the early Soviet show trials and purges took place, the targets would confess to committing treason—the details stretching credulity—and beg for execution. The Maoists (Chinese Communists) used it too, typically during “struggle sessions.” Also, forced confessions were required in Vietnam for prisoners in reeducation camps. What happened wasn’t much different from a medieval inquisition. Those targeted would be badgered until they confessed to whatever it was they supposedly did. Of course, physical forms of coercion were also an option. These weren’t actual trials; their fates were already decided.",

Ioukos : la justice française refuse de suspendre la saisie des biens de l’État « Nous ne recevons actuellement pas l'argent dû par Arianespace pour notre travail. Pas d'argent, pas de produit. Nous ne pouvons travailler gratuitement. Nous ne livrerons donc rien » , indique la source citée par l'agence AFP . En juillet 2014, le tribunal arbitral de la Haye a jugé que la Russie devait verser 46 milliards d’euros aux anciens actionnaires du groupe pétrolier Ioukos . En vertu de cette décision, plusieurs actifs russes ont été bloqués par les tribunaux en France en juin 2015. Cela concerne également les actifs de Roscosmos et de Russian Satellite Communications Company pour un montant total de 642 millions d’euros. En 2016, un tribunal français a établi que Roscosmos était juridiquement indépendant de l’État russe et que les actifs bloqués n’appartenaient donc pas au gouvernement russe et devaient être débloqués. Cependant, les anciens actionnaires de Ioukos ont fait appel de cette décision et l’argent reste toujours sous séquestre. Rappelons qu’Arianespace utilise les lanceurs russes de classe intermédiaire pour envoyer les satellites en orbite depuis le cosmodrome de Kourou en Guyane française .

Built around aging Soviet hand-me-downs, the ships they did have largely defected along with Crimea. Indeed, while they have some small attack boats and the like, it would be fair to classify Ukraine’s entire “navy” as one ship, the Hetman Sahaydachnyy, their flagship, which is in the process of being repaired and refitted. Even this ship is just a frigate, but apart from coastal patrol boats and tug boats, it is what’s left. Ukrainian Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ihor Voronchenko is playing up the repairs and upgrades to their ship as the beginning of a major increase in capacity which will allow them to “counter Russia” in the Black Sea. The US is bankrolling part of this effort with $30 million in aid. By contrast, Russia’s Black Sea Fleet includes four Frigates, a guided missile destroyer, and an even larger guided missile cruiser, the Moskva, which is roughly four times the size of Ukraine’s ship. Beyond that, Russia has half a dozen submarines in the Black Sea, along with the usual smaller boats. NATO in general and the US in particular have talked up their desire to counter Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, but the Ukrainian Navy seems far from a realistic counter in and of itself, and the US funding appears primarily aimed at buying more influence with the Ukrainian government than at trying to develop their ship as a serious fighting force.

Meme created for the #SaveHuma internet campaign. (Source: Facebook) The tongue-in-cheek memes and the #SaveHuma and #PrayForHuma hashtag campaigns are spreading like crazy, likely because of their underlying “karma’s a b*tch” Â kind of tone. The idea of poetic justice being served up to Hillary Clinton and any person who aided and abetted her criminal actsÂ is a very popular notion these days. Now that the FBI hasÂ what is most likely the missing 33,000 emails, we can be reasonably sure that actual, lawful justice is on the horizon as well, and there isn’t a hashtag on Earth that will be able to save Crooked Hillary or her favorite minion, Huma, from facing the consequences of their actions.",

Here’s his description of that process, from a debate on Dual Citizenship: Okay, okay, I know it sounds too good to be true. But the question of dual citizenship really was hotly discussed in a crowd of my fellow Americans-to-be as we all waited patiently for the judge to arrive and administer the Oath of Allegiance one summer day back in 1994. The woman behind me reflected the consensus. “Of course!” she forcefully declared to general approval, in the event of another military draft she would send her children back to the Caribbean — which she could do precisely because they all were retaining their original citizenship. While waiting to “swear allegiance”! With court officers all around! Then the judge arrived. He swore us in and told us we were now as good Americans as anyone whose family had been here 10 generations (translation: you don`t have to assimilate), and that the United States still had a major problem: racism (i.e., vote Democratic). Obviously my Caribbean friend knew something I didn`t. Intimate contact with the immigration process is one reason we immigrants usually are so much less romantic about immigration than are American intellectuals and policy wonks.",

        "content": "It’s Harder for Clinton Supporters to Respect Trump Backers Than Vice Versa John Gramlich, Pew Research, November 1, 2016 Given the rancorous tone and often highly personal nature of this year’s presidential campaign, supporters of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump might be expected to hold similarly negative views of one another. But a new Pew Research Center survey finds that Clinton backers–particularly highly educated ones–have more difficulty respecting Trump supporters than the other way around. Nearly six-in-ten registered voters who back Clinton (58%) say they have a “hard time” respecting someone who supports Trump for president; 40% say they have “no trouble” with it. Nearly the opposite is true among Trump supporters, with 56% saying they have no trouble respecting someone who backs Clinton and 40% saying they do have trouble with it. Among Clinton supporters, those with a college degree have a harder time respecting someone who prefers Trump than those who have not graduated from college. About two-thirds (66%) of college graduates who back Clinton say they have a hard time, compared with a narrower majority (53%) among Clinton supporters who have not completed college. White women who back Clinton also are particularly likely to say they have difficulty respecting those who favor Trump: 68% say this, compared with a smaller share of white men (59%) and fewer nonwhites. {snip}",

Carville voiced his anger on MSNBC this Monday at the way FBI Director James Comey has reignited the investigation into candidate Clinton’s emails. “American democracy is really under attack here,” he said, pointing the finger at Comey and House Republicans. “We do know our that democracy is under assault, ” adding, “People have to decide, do we want our country for ourselves and the people in charge or do we want the KGB and the House Republicans to decide this election?” Anchor Thomas Roberts brought up the praising of Comey by Democrats back in July, but Comey stood firm in his stance, strongly urging Roberts, “Why are you defending this?” He continued, “Why are you sitting here when our democracy is under assault, when the FBI is acting at the behest of Jason Chaffetz, and sitting here acting like this is legit, it’s not. It’s an effort to effect this election. Democrats and people across this country have to know that,” he noted resoundingly. “When the facts change you change your mind,” he continued, regarding the change in the FBI from July to now. “You’re defending an assault on the American Democracy,” Carville fumed, adding that this is, “ An unprecedented event.” Carville again cautioned that our government is at risk at the hands of Comey, the GOP. As Carville so passionately advocated, we will not let the election and our democracy be squandered at the hands of these perpetrators. Watch it here:",

Bill Kristol the evil Zionist Jew warmonger has called us Alt-Right Nazis “scaredy cats.” What a disgusting faggot this vermin is. The older conservatism: We’ll proudly fight for our country if need be. The alt-right: We’re scaredy-cats and proud of it. https://t.co/Qo58mfW91n â Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) October 28, 2016 First off, the very fact that Kristol claims to be an American is ridiculous. He is a Jew and is looking out for the interests of Israel and the members of his vile tribe before anyone else. He is not fighting for the interests of White Americans. Secondly, how many American wars has this Jew fought in? He certainly didn’t sign up to fight in Vietnam when he was of military age. This Jew would never fight on behalf of America. He’d flee to Israel at the first sign of trouble. Kristol was one of the most prominent propagandists on television pushing Americans to support the 2003 Iraq invasion. The entire war was based on lies. Iraq had no WMDs and the war has thrown the entire region into perpetual chaos. Such a situation has only been of benefit to his Jewish friends in Israel. If the Arab world is in chaos, they cannot ever come together to defeat and destroy Israel. This is why a never ending war against terror was declared after the 9/11 attacks. It justifies a continued state of chaos, death and destruction throughout the Arab world to benefit Jews. The good news is that almost every response to his tweet is negative and reflects my general commentary. If you’d like to pile on you can tweet him @BillKristol .",

        "content": "by Yves Smith Yves here. This is a very important video from the Real News Network , and I wish there were a transcript, so do take the trouble to listen to it. One of the reasons for the ferocity of the howling from the Democratic Party hackocracy in the wake of the unexpected Trump vicory is that they are effectively cornered animals. As political scientist Tom Ferguson explains, the Democrats can’t get the number of voters they need with their traditional coalition of Big Finance money plus identity politics without delivering tangible benefits to workers, which they have abjectly failed to do. But the power of mone in the Democratic party makes it well nigh impossible for them to devise the sort of populist policies that would appeal to voters that Trump has successfully peeled off. Ferguson also has some important exit poll and early, granular data that debunks some cherished Democratic party myths. For instance, playing the gender card wasn’t as successful as the media would lead you to believe. Ferguson, who has been a consistent critic of the Democrats from the left, does not rule out the idea that Trump could deliver on policies that would make him popular, most important, ones that would create more jobs and improve wages. One expert close to the Sanders camp came to the same view separately months ago. So while Trump may be stymied, or may never have been sincere about his battle call to downtrodden workers, it’s a mistake to rule out the possibility that he will continue to succeed despite the odds and his glaring character defects. 0 0 0 0 0 1",

Breitbart “We’re concerned about the possibility of Musilm terrorism and anti-gay violence such as the deadly attack on a gay nightclub in Orlando,” Starling told Breitbart News. “Trump is better on security and immigration.” LaBarbera, who drove with Starling from Savannah, Georgia, to attend the rally, agreed, adding that he also preferred Trump’s economic policies. He said that he had lost several yard signs to theft, and had endured hate on Facebook. But he added that people at Savannah’s gay pride rally had been “kind” when they set up a booth for Trump, and that Trump fans at the rally had been “supportive” as well. Other “Gays for Trump” signs have been popping up at Trump rallies elsewhere in the Sunshine State. One supporter waved a homemade sign at Trump’s rally in Orlando on Wednesday. And Trump emerged onstage in Colorado on Sunday holding a rainbow flag with the words “LGBTs for Trump” written on it. More and more gays are supporting Donald Trump. In light of the Orlando terror attack they realize that Trump is the only one who will keep them safe. Hillary helped to create ISIS with her bumbling handling of Libya and the killing of Muammar Gaddafi. In addition, Hillary Clinton supports and takes millions of dollars from Saudis, who not only abuse and execute gays, they also treat women like second-class citizens.",

Minutes after Berk sang the opening line (‘no war, let’s have peace, let’s have peace in the west and the east’), Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump reportedly ate a vegan lasagne and drew a watercolour drawing of a rainbow together, then decided to abandon their futile sparring and hand the presidency over to Greenpeace. As Berk moved on to the bridge, (a whispered repetition of ‘fuck the Tories, fuck the Tories’ over a grittily strummed G chord), Theresa May issued a statement that she and her party had been wrong over a lot of things, and were immediately going to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia and Israel, as well as scrapping trident. Bashed Al-Assad joined in minutes later, going on to the streets of Aleppo to hand out cornettos. Julian Smith, who puts on the night, said ‘it’s great to see that there’s a whole host of emerging talent in Hertford, everything from acoustic acts like James, to spoken word poets, to great rock bands like ‘Jenny and The Farmer’s Sons’. I think the world peace that James has created proves that the night is well worth the £5 entry fee.’",

In fact, the only time respect for police was higher was in 1967. Only 56 percent of Americans said they had respect for police in 2004. Just last year, only 64 percent of Americans claimed they respected police. Advertisement - story continues below The numbers were shocking, especially in light of recent officer-involved shootings, which have sparked protests all around the country. The Black Lives Matter group rallied in large cities, sparking violent protests and forcing cities to enact a curfew for the safety of their residents. Hundreds of people marching in North Carolina, Mississippi, Louisiana and other states chanting “Hands up, don’t shoot!” grabbed the media’s attention. Even the presidential campaigns focused on how to fix relations between police and the communities they serve. So do these new numbers show that the Black Lives Matter movement is not achieving what it set out to accomplish? As more protests and rallies erupt around the country, Americans respect police more and more. Maybe it’s time for the Black Lives Matter group to try a new approach.

        "content": "Officials Concede Plan Could Change, as Could Definition of 'Mosul' by Jason Ditz, November 03, 2016 Share This The US has made much of its troops involved in the Mosul invasion not being “combat” troops, even though one of the troops was killed in a roadside bombing while embedded with Kurdish combat troops. As the troops near Mosul, however, Pentagon spokesman Col. John Dorrian insists there are no plans so far for troops to enter Mosul. Col. Dorrian insisted that Iraq’s government has said “it’s just gonna be their forces.” He did, however, say he didn’t want to say US troops would “never” be involved, insisting that the plans could change at any time. Other officials, quoted anonymously by Reuters , suggested that the definition of Mosul could also change, saying that suburbs and parts of the city’s outskirts could easily be redefined as not Mosul, allowing US troops to enter those areas without having to technically “enter Mosul.” The Obama Administration initially promised “no boots on the ground” in Iraq, but with some 6,000 such troops in Iraq, they’ve seen been trying desperately to claim they are in “non-combat” roles. This too has been difficult to sell, with a number of those troops embedded in combat units. Those troops are nominally “advisers,” but are regularly being put into combat areas.

        "content": "Cayenne pepper may be the miracle first-aid spice that no one knows about! Stop bleeding in 10 seconds with this simple trick! Cayenne pepper does much more than just add spice to culinary dishes. This miracle working substance can also stop bleeding in less than one minute under most circumstances. It works miracles because cayenne pepper reacts with the body to equalize the blood pressure. This means that cayenne will keep the extra gushing of pressure from becoming concentrated in the wound area as it normally is. Blood will instead quickly clot when the pressure is equalized. Topical Application Cayenne can be sprinkled directly onto the wound with absolutely no modification. You can also dissolve it in a bit of water and saturate a piece of gauze to be placed over the wound area. Internal Application Cayenne pepper can also be taken orally. Dissolve a teaspoon of cayenne in one cup of water and drink it down. If the taste of this seems like a bit too much, simply dissolve a teaspoon of cayenne into the juice of half a lemon and a dash of maple syrup. Other Uses While cayenne can stop bleeding from exterior wounds, it also works for internal hemorrhages inside the nose, stomach, and throat if taken orally. Cayenne can also work to improve blood circulation, assist digestion, stimulate perspiration and saliva, and lessen pain from swollen or arthritic joints and limbs. Cayenne salves are great as deep heating balms for cramps, stiff neck, arthritis, sore muscles, etc. Make your own cayenne salve with olive oil, cayenne, oil of wintergreen, pure distilled mint crystals, and beeswax.",

        "content": "November 4, 2016 College Classmate Reveals HORRIFIC Story Of Time Trump Hit His Son In The Face Inside Their Dorm   Scott Melker is a Miami-based DJ who reportedly attended the University of Pennsylvania at the same time as one of the sons of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Melker recently shared a disturbing story on Facebook in which he claims that Trump very casually physically assaulted Donald Trump Jr. in front of his classmates, as well as the troubling behaviors of Don Jr., who he described as “a drunk” who earned the nickname “Diaper Don.” Image via Facebook Before we get ahead of ourselves, we should, of course, take it for what it is worth. This is just one man’s account, and for all we know, Melker could have made the whole thing up. But Melker’s account doesn’t come across as exaggerated, the alleged interaction, while disturbing, seems very understated. And here’s what we do know about Trump. He has bragged on video about how he felt his “star” status gave him permission to routinely sexually assault random women by kissing them and grabbing their genitalia against their will. Trump has also been accused of committing numerous sexual assaults against women, including raping two young teenage girls. And according to his first wife, Trump did not have the best of relationships with his three oldest children. During a benefit a few weeks ago, Ivana Trump told the crowd that she “brought up the children singlehandedly. Donald wasn’t really interested in children until he could talk business with them.” With so many deep character flaws, it’s not exactly a stretch of the imagination that he would physically lash out as well. If this story turns out to be true, it could explain a lot about why Trump’s two oldest sons are the way they are, and it could foretell a very troubling future for Trump’s youngest son Barron, who is only 10 years old.

The recording was made on September 5, 2006, by an editor of the “Jewish Press,” during a meeting with Clinton in her race for re-election to the U.S. Senator. Via The Observer : The tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to [Editor Eli] Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer. […] Speaking … about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats). In the clip, which appears below, Clinton can be heard plainly saying: I do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake. And if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.",

Eric Zuesse At 2:47 in this video about a key moment in the 7 September 2016 “Town Hall” ‘debate’ between Trump and Clinton where Matt Lauer has asked her about her privatization of her State Department emails, Ms. Clinton says, “but the real question is the handling of classified materials, which is I think what the implication of your question was.” Lauer did not deny that; he was following the line of Comey, that only the classified emails could pose a criminal problem for her. However, that assumption is flat-out false, and both Hillary Clinton knows it (which is why she tried there to narrow the meaning of his question to the classified-information issue ), and also Comey knows it (which is why he has his FBI exclude from its consideration the illegality of her privatization of official email itself — her theft of U.S. government information, her abuse of even non-confidential information, her destruction of evidence by destroying her government emails, etcetera — there are several laws she broke which have nothing to do with “confidential information,” but both the FBI and the ‘news’ media (at least until Comey’s about-face on October 28th) were ignoring them, and they still do ignore each one of them. Here are six of those laws . They describe what nobody denies that she did, and the maximum sentence under all of them, if the FBI were to “throw the book at her,” would be 72 years. Conviction of her under them would be a slam-dunk, but all of these laws are being simply ignored. So, the questions here are: Why is the FBI ignoring those criminal laws, which she clearly did violate? Why are America’s ‘news’ media ignoring the FBI’s ignoring these laws?",

        "content": "Hillary emails 'whitelisted' for Obama's BlackBerry President could only receive messages from pre-approved accounts Published: 1 min ago (Fox News) President Obama’s high-security BlackBerry used a special process known as “whitelisting” that only allowed it to take calls and messages from pre-approved contacts, two former senior intelligence officials with knowledge of the set-up told Fox News – pointing to the detail as further proof the White House knew Hillary Clinton’s private account was used for government business. As the administration now acknowledges, Obama and Clinton emailed each other while she was helming the State Department. If received on his BlackBerry, the “whitelisting” safeguard means Clinton and other contacts would have had to be approved as secure for data transmission – covering everything from emails to texts to phone calls. The Obama BlackBerry would have also been configured to accept the communications. “Think of whitelisting like a bouncer in the VIP line at the party. If you are on the list you get in, if you are not, you get bounced to the pavement,” said Bob Gourley, former chief technology officer (CTO) for the DIA, and now a partner with strategic consulting and engineering firm Cognitio.",

Con esto la entidad pretende concienciar a la sociedad para que no se perciba como un fracaso ser homosexual. Asimismo, la medida persigue la consolidación en el habla popular de la frase “Maricón el último y el penúltimo”, propiciando un aliciente extra para correr más rápido. Si la propuesta funciona, no se descarta implementarla por arriba y considerar al subcampeón “Maricón de plata”. “Creemos que ‘maricón el último’ es un concepto ya anticuado y denigrante. Necesitaba urgentemente adaptarse a los nuevos tiempos para que lo de ser maricón se considerara un acicate”, ha dicho el presidente de la federación, José Joaquín “El Bala”. La decisión ha sido aplaudida por los corredores más lentos de la federación, que se habían quejado reiteradamente de la soledad que se siente al ser el único maricón reconocido de una carrera. Pero este no es el único cambio en la normativa. Con el fin de dejar de promover el uso de armas de fuego, los jueces de pista ya no indicarán el inicio de las carreras con pistolas sino con flautines. Según la web de la federación, los atletas no podrán empezar a correr hasta que no suene la última nota de “El Himno de la Alegría”.",

You need Nathan Carter,” RTÉ insisted with a crazed look in its eyes, as it was surrounded in a supportive and safe environment by those who care about it the most. RTÉ confirmed plans to launch a third channel, RTÉ Nathan Carter, later this year in a misguided attempt to cater for the Carter mad public that only exists as a figment of the national broadcaster’s mind. “I don’t know what you’ve been told, but we didn’t ask for this,” a confused and slightly irritated Nation explained to RTÉ as it tried to wriggle free from its restraints, unwilling to engage in the intervention. “If we let you go, you have to promise not to commission a ten-part series called Nathan Carter’s Favourite Days of The Week or some shite like that,” the Nation added, still weary of the Carter obsessed broadcaster.

Instructions for how to make a hangman’s noose knot in this easy step by step video tutorial. The hangmans noose is a sliding noose knot making an adjustable loop at the end of the rope. It is also known as the collar knot or the hangman’s knot. It is claimed to be traditionally tied with nine or thirteen coils or wraps but the amount of coils can vary depending on the type and thickness or size of rope. It is knot #119 in the Ashley book of knots (ABoK). He claims that eight coils is the correct amount. It is actually the same as the uni, Duncan or grinner knot which is used in fishing to tie hooks, swivels, lures and flies. The difference is in the way the knot is tied. It is one of the strongest noose knots accounting for an enormous body count. It is most associated with lynching, hanging people from a tree, gallows and hanging executions, by tying the noose around your neck and causing neck injury. Death occurs either by breaking the neck or suffocation. Uses: Made with paracord, it can make a knife lanyard or key chain. In jewelery it is used as a pendant on necklaces. It can also be used as a heaving line knot by arborists and in tree climbing to advance the climbing line. The main advantage in that situation being that if the knot becomes stuck in a branch union or crotch a firm pull will unravel the knot and the climbing line can be retrieved. Share this:",

I had a revolver and fired at him twice.” Though he didn’t hit the burglar with his two shots, they were more than enough to send the punk scrambling back out the broken glass door and away from what turned out to be a well-defended home. “I missed, obviously, but I think I scared him,” Hough added, pointing to the bullet holes in his wall. “He certainly didn’t expect to see me.” The armed homeowner used his cellphone to call the police, who responded promptly despite the raging hurricane going on around them.

Wie heute bekannt wurde, wollen die Sozialdemokraten ebenfalls mit Angela Merkel als Kanzlerkandidatin zur Bundestagswahl 2017 antreten. Offenbar ist man in der Partei der Überzeugung, dass nur Angela Merkel die Sozialdemokraten siegreich durch den Wahlkampf führen kann. \"Wen sollen wir denn auch sonst aufstellen?\" so SPD-Generalsekretärin Katarina Barley auf Anfrage des Postillon. \"Sigmar Gabriel etwa? Andrea Nahles? Ich bitte Sie!\" Zudem zweifle ohnehin niemand daran, dass die Große Koalition auch nach 2017 bestehen bleiben wird. \"Wieso sollten wir da plötzlich auf Biegen und Brechen einen eigenen Kandidaten ins Rennen schicken und so tun, als wären wir anderer Meinung als die Union? Das kauft uns doch ohnehin keiner ab.\" Beobachter begrüßen es, dass die SPD mit Angela Merkel erstmals in ihrer Geschichte eine Frau als Kandidaten für die Kanzlerschaft aufstellt. \"Hier werden die Sozialdemokraten wieder einmal ihrer Vorreiterrolle in Sachen gesellschaftlicher Fortschritt voll und ganz gerecht\", erklärt Politikwissenschaftler Uwe Laumann aus Rostock. \"Zudem hat Merkel als sozialdemokratische Spitzenkandidatin den Vorteil, dass im Falle eines SPD-Wahlsiehihihi- … entschuldigen Sie bitte, ich musste gerade selbst lachen. Vergessen Sie den letzten Punkt einfach.\" Spannend dürfte es bei den TV-Duellen vor der Wahl werden, wenn Angela Merkel mit sich selbst wichtige grundsatzpolitische Fragen ausdiskutiert. Es ist davon auszugehen, dass Merkel versuchen wird, sich selbst mit ihrer betont ruhigen Art aus der Reserve zu locken und einen Wutausbruch zu provozieren. fed, dan, ssi; Foto: Armin Linnartz , CC BY-SA 3.0 Artikel teilen:",

He has finally decided to come forward and break silence on his experience, but for the some reason the Clinton’s have refused to deny a thing that he says. Even more shocking is when you take a closer look at Hillary’s ex-lover, it appears that he was shot in the head and Hillary’s odd behavior is having many claim murder. Many of those paying close attention to the Clintons’ suspicious dealings and sketchy behavior over the years have long since thought that longtime ally and lawyer Vince Foster was indeed having an affair with the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Well, Clinton’s fixer, Jeff Rovin, just confirmed these suspicions. Rovin admitted to Sean Hannity, on the record, that Hillary Clinton and Foster had indeed been having an affair for many years. This is especially interesting when we analyze the questionable circumstances of Foster’s death that was ruled as a suicide. Foster died of a gunshot wound to the head and a great deal of people who have analyzed the facts strongly believe that it was not a suicide at all, but rather murder. Rovin proceeded to run down this road without intending to when he described Hillary’s reaction to Foster’s death: He [Rovin] claimed to have helped scrub the office of Vince Foster to snatch documents related to the Whitewater scandal and covered up an alleged affair between Hillary and Foster. But Rovin told Hannity he was tasked with distracting the media while Hillary’s crew rummaged through Foster’s office. He also called the Hillary-Foster affair “pretty much an open secret.” It just seems too close to be coincidence. Miguel Rodriguez, the lead prosecutor in the case submitted a 2-page resignation",

This massive pile of debt was accumulated at zero percent interest rates, but that certainly isn’t where rates will stay. Failed policies and a very harsh turning of the screw against the population has made raising interest rates at the Federal Reserve inevitable… for a couple of years now, Janet Yellen has been merely waiting for the right time, which many have speculated was waiting on the results of the election.

There cannot be any justification for that.] Attorney General Loretta Lynch is declining to comply with an investigation by [mis]leading members of Congress about the Obama administration’s secret efforts to send Iran $1.7 billion in cash earlier this year, prompting accusations that Lynch has “pleaded the Fifth” Amendment to avoid incriminating herself over these payments, according to lawmakers and communications exclusively obtained by the Washington Free Beacon . Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) and Rep. Mike Pompeo (R., Kan.) initially presented Lynch in October with a series of questions about how the cash payment to Iran was approved and delivered. In an Oct. 24 response , Assistant Attorney General Peter Kadzik responded on Lynch’s behalf, refusing to answer the questions and informing the lawmakers that they are barred from publicly disclosing any details about the cash payment, which was bound up in a ransom deal aimed at freeing several American hostages from Iran. The response from the attorney general’s office is “unacceptable” and provides evidence that Lynch has chosen to “essentially plead the fifth and refuse to respond to inquiries regarding [her] role in providing cash to the world’s foremost state sponsor of terrorism,” Rubio and Pompeo wrote on Friday in a follow-up letter to Lynch, according to a copy obtained by the Free Beacon .",

Employee Emailed Veterans’ Personal Data to Himself By Arnaldo Rodgers on November 11, 2016 VA By dan elliott The Department of Veterans Affairs has warned more than 2,100 veterans in Eastern Colorado and parts of Kansas that their personal information may have been compromised when an employee emailed documents to himself. An agency employee told The Associated Press that he is the person who emailed the information to himself, describing it as unauthorized wait lists used by VA health care facilities in Colorado. The employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he fears retaliation, said he wanted to document the lists because they could have been used to conceal lengthy delays in providing care. In Wednesday’s warning to veterans, the VA said the potentially compromised information included veterans’ full names, the last four digits of their Social Security numbers and medical diagnoses. The agency said the employee emailed it to himself in unencrypted form.

Resorting to ‘making do’ with rollies that look like the inside of a bookie’s pen, Muldoon splashes out on proper cigarettes every four weeks or so, or whenever he has a spare tenner in his pocket or if he just feels that his lungs are due ‘a treat’. “Rollies are alright, but it’s like putting together a Kinder Surprise toy every time you want a smoke,” explains Muldoon. “And they’re a nightmare when you’ve a few pints on board, trying to put together a cigarette like Lego with a filter stuck in the corner of your mouth while you get bumped by people from all sides. So it’s nice to just open a pack and boom; there’s a smoke waiting for you. Open it again, there’s another! And another and another! It’s just the most magical experience in the world”.

        "content": "October 30, 2016 - Fort Russ News - -  Sputnik France , translated by Tom Winter - While the European Parliament makes preparations about exempting Ukrainian citizens from the visa obligation, the figures are speaking volumes about the prospects of this measure: more than half of Ukrainians are ready to leave their country.  About 30% of Ukrainians would want to flee the country, according to a recent survey conducted by the \"Raiting\" group. An even greater number of respondents, 40%, would wish to work abroad, citing the difficulty of \"a decent life\" in Ukraine.  While in the immediate aftermath of the Maidan, 58% of Ukrainians were against the idea of leaving the country, but three years later, only 28% completely reject the idea. Explaining their choice, the respondents put forward their hopes of having better living conditions and ensuring a happy future for their children. Notable also is the fact that the majority of potential migrants live in the western and central regions of Ukraine, ie those closest to the border with the EU. In 2015, about 9.5 million Ukrainian migrants crossed the Polish border.  Is the EU about to withstand a new wave of migration? No need to wait long for the answer. The new statistics are a reminder of the promise made just yesterday by Piotr Poroshenko. The visa-free regime between Ukraine and the EU will be in place by November 24, he said yesterday, adding that Kiev had fulfilled all its commitments to Brussels.  The obligations to stop the war in the southwest and improve living standards in the country apparently were not part of the list.

Russia has repeatedly denied involvement in such plots.NATO has played up the Russian threat to justify sending over 40,000 ground troops to the Russian border, with ever-growing numbers announced all the time.

Sheer, stomach-churning panic. You see, up until now I had done a somewhat decent job of not allowing myself to imagine the unimaginable: Donald Trump winning. But as election day looms closer, and the racism and sexism that infects Trump’s campaign is ratcheted up, it’s hard not to be terrified. In the past week, a Ku Klux Klan newspaper endorsed Trump and white supremacists announced their plan for widespread voter intimidation. Trump rally-goers shouted antisemitic invective at reporters, and a historically black church in Mississippi was burned and “vote Trump” scrawled across the side. Another woman came forward to accuse Trump of sexual assault , and a Texas official called Hillary Clinton a “cunt”. This isn’t a political divide between left and right, Democrats and Republicans; it’s an immeasurable moral chasm. And so I understand why it’s been easier for many horrified by Trump to simply pretend there’s no way that he could actually win the presidency. Read more at Guardian UK Related Posts:",

Protestors and Native American activists have set up a new camp called “Front-Line Camp” where they are making their last stand against the party Energy Transfer Partners, who are working on the Pipeline. The Sioux Tribe has declared eminent domain over the water rights and sacred land rights in the same area as the Pipeline is being built. They are asking for prayers as they make a great stand against the destruction of their sacred land. Pipeline opponents attempting to protect their water supply from the Dakota Access oil pipeline (DAPL), as well as prevent the continued destruction of burial grounds and cultural sites, are anticipating a confrontation with police today. This news come after “water protectors” refused law enforcement requests to vacate reoccupied land in the pipeline’s path, owned by Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners. http://thesccop.com/breaking-no-fly-zone-declared-as-militarized-police-prep-for-assault-on-front-line-camp-at-standing-rock/ While Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Chairman Harold Frazier sat down with President Barack Obama at a private roundtable in Los Angeles on Tuesday, October 25, Morton County, N.D. Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier was calling in police reinforcements from six states to enforce Energy Transfer Partners’ demands that “trespassers” be removed from the path of the pipeline. Authorities implied they may forcibly remove the water protectors from the new camp, which is on land recently purchased by Dakota Access LLC, the subsidiary that is building the pipeline. “We have the resources. We could go down there at any time,” Cass County Sheriff Paul Laney said, according to the Associated Press . “We’re trying not to.” “We are here to enforce the law as needed,” Morton County Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier said. “It’s private property.” Share: Rate:",

        "content": "The occupation eventually ended on Jan. 26, when the Bundys and other key occupiers were arrested at a traffic stop. One of the occupiers, Robert “LaVoy” Funicum, was killed during that altercation. Speaking with The Oregonian , the attorneys for the various defendants expressed satisfaction with the jury’s decision. “More than we could have hoped for,” said Morgan Philpot, one of the attorneys for Ammon Bundy.   “Stunning,” added defense lawyer Lisa Ludwig, who was serving as standby counsel for Ryan Bundy. “I’m just thrilled,” chimed in Lisa Maxfield, an attorney for one of the five other defendants. There was just one problem. The Bundys were still expected to stand trial in Nevada for an earlier standoff that occurred several years prior. Moreover, U.S. Marshals present at the verdict hearing Tuesday reportedly had a retainer for Ammon. This led to an in-court altercation, and he was again placed in custody. This snafu aside, the ruling was, according to The Oregonian, “a remarkable blow to the federal government as it tries to tamp down a national movement … to open public lands to ranchers, miners and loggers.”  ",

        "content": "Leave a reply Greg Hunter – There are numerous reports on the alternative media of documents being given to WikiLeaks to counter the corruption and lawlessness of the Obamas and Clintons. AG Loretta Lynch has been reportedly blocking an FBI investigation into the Clinton Foundation that many say is a “global charity fraud” and a “huge criminal conspiracy.” The leaked emails and documents show corruption between the Justice Department and Hillary Clinton. These documents and emails also show a grand cover-up of the true treason that has taken place in the highest offices of the U.S. government. The mainstream media (MSM) have been committing fraud on shareholders and the public by holding themselves out as “news organizations” when, in fact, they are functioning as propaganda for the Clinton campaign. It’s no surprise that the nation’s biggest newspaper, USA Today (GCI), has had its share price cut in half in the last a year. Reuters is laying off 2,000 people, and quarterly profits at the New York Times have fallen by 95%. The public is not buying the lies and propaganda the MSM is selling for the Democrats and the Clinton Campaign. Internet researcher Clif High says both the MSM and the Democrat Party are dying. He says by 2020, the Democrat party will not exist, and the MSM will be well on its way to its death. Join Greg Hunter as he talks about these stories and more in the Weekly News Wrap-Up.

The Federal Marshals refused to release him. Mumford insisted that they show the paperwork that allowed them to keep Ammon in custody. They wouldn’t show the paperwork. When Mumford refused to accept that as an answer, about eight federal marshals attacked Attorney Mumford IN THE COURT ROOM! They tasered him and arrested him!!”During the trial the attorney was told by the judge that he could not mention the defendants’ spokesperson who was shot down by police for no reason. http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/northwest/judge-threatens-to-fine-ammon-bundys-lawyer-in-malheur-refuge-case/ The high-handedness of the Feds apparently was more than the jury could accept.The post Jury Rejects Federal Case Against Malheur Wildlife Refuge Defandants appeared first on PaulCraigRoberts.org .",

        "content": "Print [Ed. – It does seem a bit thoughtless of the Italians, to have not at least arranged to clothe the migrants from the couture designers’ off-the-rack lines.] African migrants who took the streets in protest and blocked traffic in Venice this week have been demanding designer clothes, the president of the Cooperativa Sociale Onlus has revealed. Lorenzo Chinalleto, whose cooperative hosts migrants at the Hotel Byron in the Venice province, said migrants respond with displeasure when receiving clothes from Catholic charity Caritas and other charitable bodies, because the goods are unbranded. He explained: “Unfortunately they come to Italy with the asylum reception systems of northern Europe as a model. When they arrived we gave them clothes, standard clothes. “But they want brand-name clothes like Armani and Boss, and they asked for Pirelli shoes. These are their models. When they came to us, they didn’t have clothes, but they all had smartphones,” the Italian added . Forty of the migrants hosted at the Hotel Byron took to the streets to express their dissatisfaction, blocking the traffic. In a video taken outside the hotel on Monday protesters can be seen shouting, in English, that they don’t want to eat pasta. The migrants originate mostly from Senegal, Nigeria, Somalia, Mali and Ghana, Il Gazzettino reported .",

        "content": "Offensive Aims to Reopen Supply Lines to Nusra-Held East by Jason Ditz, October 28, 2016 Share This With al-Qaeda’s Nusra Front losing territory in recent weeks around Aleppo, and seeing their main stronghold in the city’s east increasingly surrounded, the group and some of its allies have launched a new offensive south of the city aimed at opening the supply lines back up. Clashes have been reported throughout the day in several areas around government-held western Aleppo , with the attackers coming from further west, likely reinforcements from Nusra’s main territory, the Idlib Province. Locals described substantial fighting. This has been a recurring feature in the battle over Aleppo since 2012, but particularly over the past several months, with each side getting a sizeable advantage only to lose it to a sudden counterattack from the other, leaving the civilian population trapped within. Over the past few weeks, however, it had seemed like Aleppo was really going to be reunified by the military, with Nusra forces on their heels and Russia feeling confident enough to put their airstrikes on hold. Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered the ceasefire to continue, despite calls from the military to resume attacks. Exactly how far the latest offensive has gotten is a major of debate, with Nusra claiming they’d captured a suburb that amounts to the whole southwestern corner of Aleppo, and government officials denying that they’d lost anywhere near so much. As usual, it will take some time for this to shake out and become clear what territory changed hands. Last 5 posts by Jason Ditz",
